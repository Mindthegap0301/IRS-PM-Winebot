Or they were sick of the sacramental wine. Maybe it was divine inspiration? We’ll never know for sure. What we do know is that the Hoegaarden monks were the first to discover the unique recipe for wheat beer around 1445. Wheat beer caused a bit of a stir in Hoegaarden. In all honesty, Hoegaarden became one big brewery in the 18th century. In 1709, the village had no less than 12 breweries. In 1726, that number had increased to 36. Oh and let’s not forget the 110 malt houses. The last brewery in Hoegaarden, Tomsin, closed shop in 1957. Soon after, in 1965, the villagers decided to take action to preserve the original recipe. Milkman Pierre Celis took the bull by the horns and started brewing up a batch in his milk shed, using only a copper boiler. He quickly expanded his operation and moved into a bigger building – ‘De Kluis’ (The Vault) – a subtle nod to the monks. By 1985 the nod was no longer subtle as he was making more than 75.000 hectolitres per year. Just as he was about to start exporting to the United States, a rather large fire flattened his dreams (and the beer). The brewery was destroyed.","“A unique, authentic Belgian wheat beer first brewed in 1445.

In memoriam, you can find his last name on the brewery and every bottle of Stella Artois around the world. By 1366 the roots of their brewing tradition had been established in the city of Leuven, Belgium– which is also where the original Den Hoorn brewery was founded. Den Hoorn laid the foundation for the quality taste and standard Stella Artois is known for. The symbol of the Den Hoorn Brewery is proudly displayed in Stella Artois' cartouche to this day. The Artois Brewery was so beloved internationally and locally, a special batch was created as a Christmas gift to the people of Leuven. That special batch was the first to officially include ""Stella"" in its name. ""Stella"", meaning star in Latin, pays homage to this original occasion, accompanied by a star on every bottle. So next time you see a bottle of Stella Artois, take note of the rich history paired with the rich flavor on and in every bottle.","“Stella Artois is the result of hundreds of years of brewing expertise so it’s worth just a few extra steps to ensure the best possible tasting experience for connoisseurs such as you. Before being poured, we always recommend it has been chilled to between 3-5°C and of course you should savour Stella Artois in its unique Chalice, the curves of which are designed to enhance the tempting taste and aroma.

Duvel is a natural beer with a subtle bitterness, a refined flavour and a distinctive hop character. The unique brewing process, which takes about 90 days, guarantees a pure character, delicate effervescence and a pleasant sweet taste of alcohol. Apart from pure spring water, which is the main ingredient of beer, barley is the most important raw material. Barley must germinate for five days in the malt house, after which malt remains. The colour of the malt and as a consequence also of the beer is determined by the temperature. Duvel obtains its typical bitterness by adding various varieties of aromatic Slovenian and Czech hops. Duvel ferments for the first time in tanks at 20 to 26°C. The brewer uses his own culture for this. The original yeast strain, which Albert Moortgat himself selected in the 1920’s, originates from Scotland. After maturing in storage tanks in which the beer is cooled down to -2°C, the drink is ready for bottling. Thanks to the addition of extra sugars and yeast, the beer ferments again in the bottle. This occurs in warm cellars (24°C) and takes two weeks. Then the beer is moved to cold cellars, where it continues to mature and stabilise for a further six weeks. This extra long maturation period is unique and contributes to the refined flavour and pure taste of Duvel. A team of beer specialists checks the process daily by means of taste analyses. It is only after 90 days, when it has achieved its rich range of flavours, that Duvel may leave the brewery.","“A Duvel is ready to drink if it has been chilled in the refrigerator to the ideal temperature of about 5°C. Another equally important factor is a clean, dry Duvel glass at room temperature.Leave about 1 cm of beer in the bottle. This contains the yeast which can make the beer rather cloudy and bitter.”",,,,,[],8.5,330.0ml,No,Belgium,Ale,Duvel

Such a magnificent place could not be forgotten, he believed, and he vowed to bring the Leffe beer back. Father Nys and the brewer set about the challenge with vigour…and succeeded. Shortly after, the Leffe brewery was back in full effect. After Leffe Brown, a beer that shone brighter than the sun saw the light of day; they named it Leffe Blond – a beautiful chapter for Leffe indeed. While this is a perfect aperitif beer, it also tastes delicious with a wide variety of dishes, especially red meat, sweet and sour dishes and white mould cheese, such as Camenbert, Brie, Brillat-Savarin or Saint-Marcellin. There are countless soft-centred cheeses that are a good match for the fresh and fruity Leffe Blond.

Back in the day there were two hop varieties coming out of the North West of the US that really took our fancy; Cascade and Chinook hops. These hops packed an addictive punch and gave rise to the super hoppy American Pale Ale, a style that inspired us back then and still inspires us today. Since day one, we have brewed our Pale using whole hop cones, sourced straight from the US directly to our breweries (something pretty unique) and use our hop back to extract those beautiful, hoppy aromas and delicate bitterness.

Or they were sick of the sacramental wine. Maybe it was divine inspiration? We’ll never know for sure. What we do know is that the Hoegaarden monks were the first to discover the unique recipe for wheat beer around 1445. Wheat beer caused a bit of a stir in Hoegaarden. In all honesty, Hoegaarden became one big brewery in the 18th century. In 1709, the village had no less than 12 breweries. In 1726, that number had increased to 36. Oh and let’s not forget the 110 malt houses. The last brewery in Hoegaarden, Tomsin, closed shop in 1957. Soon after, in 1965, the villagers decided to take action to preserve the original recipe. Milkman Pierre Celis took the bull by the horns and started brewing up a batch in his milk shed, using only a copper boiler. He quickly expanded his operation and moved into a bigger building – ‘De Kluis’ (The Vault) – a subtle nod to the monks. By 1985 the nod was no longer subtle as he was making more than 75.000 hectolitres per year. Just as he was about to start exporting to the United States, a rather large fire flattened his dreams (and the beer). The brewery was destroyed.","“A unique, authentic Belgian wheat beer first brewed in 1445. The taste of Hoegaarden is unique and complex: sweet and sour with a note of bitterness, a spicy echo of coriander, and a hint of orange.”",The beer has a cloudy and hazy look with nice frothy lace.

Den Hoorn laid the foundation for the quality taste and standard Stella Artois is known for. The symbol of the Den Hoorn Brewery is proudly displayed in Stella Artois' cartouche to this day. The Artois Brewery was so beloved internationally and locally, a special batch was created as a Christmas gift to the people of Leuven.

So next time you see a bottle of Stella Artois, take note of the rich history paired with the rich flavor on and in every bottle.","“Stella Artois is the result of hundreds of years of brewing expertise so it’s worth just a few extra steps to ensure the best possible tasting experience for connoisseurs such as you.

Filtered water is flown to their headquarters in St. Louis from around the country daily and tested for purity by our Brewmaster. Taste testing water to brew beer… That’s a commitment to quality.","“Budweiser was first introduced by Adolphus Busch in 1876 and it's still brewed with the same high standards today.The 24 Can Case served ice cold is perfect for BBQs, after a hard day at work, or stocking up for home.”",,,,,[],5.0,330.0ml,No,United States,Lager,Budweiser

Duvel is a natural beer with a subtle bitterness, a refined flavour and a distinctive hop character. The unique brewing process, which takes about 90 days, guarantees a pure character, delicate effervescence and a pleasant sweet taste of alcohol. Apart from pure spring water, which is the main ingredient of beer, barley is the most important raw material. Barley must germinate for five days in the malt house, after which malt remains. The colour of the malt and as a consequence also of the beer is determined by the temperature. Duvel obtains its typical bitterness by adding various varieties of aromatic Slovenian and Czech hops. Duvel ferments for the first time in tanks at 20 to 26°C. The brewer uses his own culture for this. The original yeast strain, which Albert Moortgat himself selected in the 1920’s, originates from Scotland. After maturing in storage tanks in which the beer is cooled down to -2°C, the drink is ready for bottling. Thanks to the addition of extra sugars and yeast, the beer ferments again in the bottle. This occurs in warm cellars (24°C) and takes two weeks. Then the beer is moved to cold cellars, where it continues to mature and stabilise for a further six weeks. This extra long maturation period is unique and contributes to the refined flavour and pure taste of Duvel. A team of beer specialists checks the process daily by means of taste analyses. It is only after 90 days, when it has achieved its rich range of flavours, that Duvel may leave the brewery.","“A Duvel is ready to drink if it has been chilled in the refrigerator to the ideal temperature of about 5°C. Another equally important factor is a clean, dry Duvel glass at room temperature.Leave about 1 cm of beer in the bottle. This contains the yeast which can make the beer rather cloudy and bitter.”",,,,,[],8.5,330.0ml,No,Belgium,Ale,Duvel

Such a magnificent place could not be forgotten, he believed, and he vowed to bring the Leffe beer back. Father Nys and the brewer set about the challenge with vigour…and succeeded. Shortly after, the Leffe brewery was back in full effect. After Leffe Brown, a beer that shone brighter than the sun saw the light of day; they named it Leffe Blond – a beautiful chapter for Leffe indeed. While this is a perfect aperitif beer, it also tastes delicious with a wide variety of dishes, especially red meat, sweet and sour dishes and white mould cheese, such as Camenbert, Brie, Brillat-Savarin or Saint-Marcellin.
