                  Aokishuzo has an illustrious 300-year history of sake brewing, and its owner credits long-standing relationships with all the stakeholders for its continuing success. If you ever have the fortune of visiting Niigata prefecture during winter, it’s well worth making a detour to the Uonuma city. Famed for heavy snowfall, it’s not uncommon to see the rather magnificent sight of piles of snow the height of a two-storey house lining the streets. The heavy snowfall helps purify the water when it seeps into the ground, aiding in the creation of exceptional sake that’s light yet tasty.

Aokishuzo produces 34 different types of sake under three labels: Kakurei, Yakiotoko, and Bokushi. Roughly 70 percent of the sake is bought and consumed in Niigata prefecture, while the rest is exported to other parts of Japan and around the world.
