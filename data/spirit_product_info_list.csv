                  Smirnoff No. 21 is the world's No. 1 vodka. Its classic taste has inspired other varieties throughout all four corners of the globe.

The Smirnoff brand was founded in 1864 by Piotr Arseneevich Smirnov and before long, he became one of the most famous vodka makers in Russia. In 1886, he even received the Tsar¡¯s special designation as a Purveyor of the Imperial Court, which is a fancy way of saying Official Vodka-Maker of Tsar Type People. This was based both on the fact that his vodkas were delicious and that Tsars tend to like to make things official.

When the Bolsheviks took over, the distilleries were shut down and P.A.¡¯s son Vladimir was chased out of town with pitchforks and also dinner forks, since the whole thing happened suddenly and not everyone had a pitchfork with them.

Vladimir Smirnov was able to flee to Constantinople and then eventually settle in France where he sold vodka under the name ¡°Smirnoff.¡± Now safely disguised by a new name and a slightly offensive fake French accent, Vladimir revived the brand.

One of the most famous whiskey brands worldwide. Jack Daniel's is a light and sweet Tennessee whiskey, produced in the traditional method of Jack Daniel's distillery.

","¡°Jasper (Jack) Newton Daniel, the founder of the whiskey distillery in Tennessee and the inventor of the double charcoal filtration (""Lincoln County Process""), died in 1911 as a result of blood poisoning. The legend tells that the origin of the poisoning was an infection in his leg, following an injury he sustained when he kicked the office safe, after he forgot the code once again, and had a paranoia attack, in fear that his nephew sold the secret recipes to the competitors. The incident inspired the slogan that was published later: ""never go to work early"".¡±",I really enjoy Jack Daniels sometimes with it's sweet aroma and taste.

One of the most famous whiskey brands worldwide. Jack Daniel's is a light and sweet Tennessee whiskey, produced in the traditional method of Jack Daniel's distillery.

In 2006 Jack Daniel's Black Label took the first place from Johnnie Walker Red Label, and won the title ""best-selling whiskey in the world"".
","¡°Jasper (Jack) Newton Daniel, the founder of the whiskey distillery in Tennessee and the inventor of the double charcoal filtration (""Lincoln County Process""), died in 1911 as a result of blood poisoning. The legend tells that the origin of the poisoning was an infection in his leg, following an injury he sustained when he kicked the office safe, after he forgot the code once again, and had a paranoia attack, in fear that his nephew sold the secret recipes to the competitors. The incident inspired the slogan that was published later: ""never go to work early"".¡±",I really enjoy Jack Daniels sometimes with it's sweet aroma and taste.

This is a blended of malt and grain whiskies. It has the name simply due to the color of the label. Eigashima Shuzo Co. Ltd. is one of the oldest family-run distillery with nearly 100 years of whisky-making experience in Japan. Established in 1679, Eigashima was once considered among the top 100 Japanese corporations during the Meiji period (the peak era in Japanese history). Eigashima has been making sake and shochu with Japanese traditional craftsmanship since 1888, and as the first distillery to obtain a license to make whisky in Japan in 1919, is a true pioneer in its field. Known for its clean air and water, the city of Akashi is located in close proximity of Osaka, which overlooks the beautiful Seto Inland Sea; Akashi is the only distillery in Japan situated by the sea. With the translated ¡°HONESTY¡± as the company motto throughout the centuries, Eigashima¡¯s ninth generation leader, Mr. Hiraishi has uncompromising standards for each drop of it¡¯s products. It releases its whisky under the name ""White Oak"".

Akashi whisky is the only whisky in the world that is made by a Toji (grand-master in the art of sake making) by implementing sake-making methodologies into the whisky making process. The distil pot used is smaller than those used by both Scottish and other Japanese distilleries, which in turn, decreases the levels of fusel alcohol. As a result, Akashi whisky does not require as long of an ageing process, while its core malt (cask strength) is smooth and delicate. Akashi White Oak is a blended whisky reserved in Japanese Shochu cask (American Oak) for 3 years, aged in ex-bourbon casks before finishing in ex-sherry casks for 2 years.

The warm, complex taste of Disaronno has a history dating back to one of the most romantic and creative periods in Italian history ¨C the Renaissance. In 1525, artist Bernardino Luini, a brilliant pupil of Leonardo da Vinci ¨C was commissioned to paint a fresco of the Madonna of the Miracles in Saronno (Madonna dei Miracoli in Saronno, where the Fresco is still displayed today). To portray the Madonna of the Miracles, Bernardino chose a beautiful local innkeeper as his muse. To express her gratitude, she prepared a special gift for the artist, namely, a flask full of an amber liqueur, fragrant and delicate. That is how the legend of Disaronno arose: from a simple gesture of kindness and the unique handmade combination of secret ingredients. Its velvety smooth taste and unmistakable aroma gave Disaronno the reputation of the world¡¯s favourite Italian liqueur, which is also stated proudly on its label.

                  Aokishuzo has an illustrious 300-year history of sake brewing, and its owner credits long-standing relationships with all the stakeholders for its continuing success. If you ever have the fortune of visiting Niigata prefecture during winter, it¡¯s well worth making a detour to the Uonuma city. Famed for heavy snowfall, it¡¯s not uncommon to see the rather magnificent sight of piles of snow the height of a two-storey house lining the streets. The heavy snowfall helps purify the water when it seeps into the ground, aiding in the creation of exceptional sake that¡¯s light yet tasty.

Aokishuzo produces 34 different types of sake under three labels: Kakurei, Yakiotoko, and Bokushi. Roughly 70 percent of the sake is bought and consumed in Niigata prefecture, while the rest is exported to other parts of Japan and around the world.

Ardbeg Ten Years Old is revered around the world as the peatiest, smokiest, most complex single malt of them all. Yet it does not flaunt the peat; rather it gives way to the natural sweetness of the malt to produce a whisky of perfect balance. Typically most whiskies are chill-filtered and reduced to a strength of 40% ABV. Ardbeg Ten Years Old, however, is non chill-filtered and has a strength of 46% ABV, thus retaining maximum flavour, at the same time giving more body and added depth.

The story of Aviation Gin begins in summer, 2005 at a small party in West Seattle where bartender Ryan Magarian is handed a complex summer botanical infusion by a friend from Portland, Oregon. Finding it unlike anything he had ever tasted, he quickly seeks out its maker, Portlands House Spirits Distillery. Recognizing a common interest in spirit, cocktail, and food interactions, the distillers at House Spirits share with Ryan their idea for a renegade regional gin style. In June of 2006 after nearly 30 rounds of trialsa Aviation Gin takes wing. Many believe this to be the first brand partnership between distiller and bartender in American history.

The story of Aviation Gin begins in summer, 2005 at a small party in West Seattle where bartender Ryan Magarian is handed a complex summer botanical infusion by a friend from Portland, Oregon. Finding it unlike anything he had ever tasted, he quickly seeks out its maker, Portlands House Spirits Distillery. Recognizing a common interest in spirit, cocktail, and food interactions, the distillers at House Spirits share with Ryan their idea for a renegade regional gin style. In June of 2006 after nearly 30 rounds of trialsa Aviation Gin takes wing. Many believe this to be the first brand partnership between distiller and bartender in American history.

Ballechin is the heavily peated distillation we have been making at Edradour Distillery since 2003. Distilled using barley which has been infused with peat to a level not less than 50ppm. This bottling is predominantly from ex Bourbon casks with a generous top dressing of ex Oloroso Sherry casks, to create added depth and greater complexity. It has been bottled at 46%, without chillfiltration, to retain the true cask character. The name Ballechin originates from a fellow Perthshire farm distillery, which sadly closed its doors in 1927. There, Alfred Barnard, who catalogued all the distilleries in the UK in the 1880¡¯s, made reference to having experienced a peated whisky.

The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 year old single malt whisky gains its distinctive character from being matured in two wood types. To make The Balvenie DoubleWood, David Stewart MBE takes whisky that has spent at least 12 years in traditional whisky casks, American Oak ex-bourbon barrels and hogsheads, and moves it to Spanish oak ex-Oloroso sherry casks for an additional nine months. The whisky is then transferred to large oak vessels called ¡°tuns¡± for 3-4 months to allow the whiskies to ¡°marry¡±. Each stage lends different qualities to the resulting single malt whisky. The traditional casks soften and add delicate character, the sherry wood brings depth and fullness of flavour and the final few months in our tuns allow the whiskies to marry harmoniously.

The first batch of Beluga Noble Russian Vodka was produced in 2002. It was the first and the dearest to the makers hearts! This was the result of the meticulous hard work of the Mariinsk Distillery masters. The refined, rich taste of Beluga Noble Russian Vodka results from its unique composition, mainly due to the malt spirit and the purest water of the Siberian artesian wells. This helps to smoothen the taste of vodka. These carefully selected natural components pass through a triple filtering system. Afterwards, Beluga Noble is left to rest for 30 days. Such method helps to neutralize the harsh smell of the spirit and to enhance the rich taste and soft flavor of Beluga Russian Noble Vodka.
","¡°Water is the key component in the production of Beluga vodka, accounting for 60% of its unique formula. It comes from 300-meter deep artesian wells in the bedrock of Siberia. Another principal component in the Beluga recipe is a special malt spirit, rarely found today in regular vodka, mainly due to its cost and the labor-intensive production technologies it requires. Yet, there is another important secret in Beluga's recipe: its production cycle includes a final, conclusive phase ¨C maturation. Depending on the vodka's grade it may last from one to three months.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

Ballechin is the heavily peated distillation we have been making at Edradour Distillery since 2003. Distilled using barley which has been infused with peat to a level not less than 50ppm. This bottling is predominantly from ex Bourbon casks with a generous top dressing of ex Oloroso Sherry casks, to create added depth and greater complexity. It has been bottled at 46%, without chillfiltration, to retain the true cask character. The name Ballechin originates from a fellow Perthshire farm distillery, which sadly closed its doors in 1927. There, Alfred Barnard, who catalogued all the distilleries in the UK in the 1880¡¯s, made reference to having experienced a peated whisky.

The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 year old single malt whisky gains its distinctive character from being matured in two wood types. To make The Balvenie DoubleWood, David Stewart MBE takes whisky that has spent at least 12 years in traditional whisky casks, American Oak ex-bourbon barrels and hogsheads, and moves it to Spanish oak ex-Oloroso sherry casks for an additional nine months. The whisky is then transferred to large oak vessels called ¡°tuns¡± for 3-4 months to allow the whiskies to ¡°marry¡±. Each stage lends different qualities to the resulting single malt whisky. The traditional casks soften and add delicate character, the sherry wood brings depth and fullness of flavour and the final few months in our tuns allow the whiskies to marry harmoniously.

A light bulb moment when travelling in Japan inspired Desmond Payne, our¡­ Master Distiller, to realise tea's potential as a botanical. In Japan, quinine was strictly banned from the production of tonics resulting in a far sweeter mixer for the traditional G&T. To quench his thirst, Desmond chose to mix Beefeater gin with chilled green tea, as an alternative to the sweet local tonics. The resulting gin and tea combination was remarkable and inspired Desmond to spend the next 18 months trialing and experimenting with different teas and botanical blends.

The first batch of Beluga Noble Russian Vodka was produced in 2002. It was the first and the dearest to the makers hearts! This was the result of the meticulous hard work of the Mariinsk Distillery masters. The refined, rich taste of Beluga Noble Russian Vodka results from its unique composition, mainly due to the malt spirit and the purest water of the Siberian artesian wells. This helps to smoothen the taste of vodka. These carefully selected natural components pass through a triple filtering system. Afterwards, Beluga Noble is left to rest for 30 days. Such method helps to neutralize the harsh smell of the spirit and to enhance the rich taste and soft flavor of Beluga Russian Noble Vodka.
","¡°Water is the key component in the production of Beluga vodka, accounting for 60% of its unique formula. It comes from 300-meter deep artesian wells in the bedrock of Siberia. Another principal component in the Beluga recipe is a special malt spirit, rarely found today in regular vodka, mainly due to its cost and the labor-intensive production technologies it requires. Yet, there is another important secret in Beluga's recipe: its production cycle includes a final, conclusive phase ¨C maturation. Depending on the vodka's grade it may last from one to three months.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

","¡°CHARACTER: Smooth as pebbles in a pool. It¡¯s clean, fresh and lively with both the oak and the grain in perfect harmony.COLOUR: Sunlight on fields of early summer barleyNOSE: The bouquet is brilliant. Opening with barley sugar and a hint of mint before leading into the most wonderful notes of freshly cut wild flowers; buttercup, daisy, meadowsweet, myrtle, primrose and cherry blossom. The cleanliness of the spirit is remarkable. As the seconds tick by, more aromas rise from the glass, little zephyrs of spindrift and sea pinks reminding you that this spirit is matured exclusively by the sea. After some four or five minutes and with the addition of a little water, caramelisd fruits drift onto the scene; lemon drops and honey, tangerine and tablet.PALATE: The palate entry is so refined and refreshing, the sweet oak and the barley arriving together sending the taste buds into raptures. The fruits from distillation drift in on an Atlantic breeze and pop on the tongue like champagne bubbles. A combination of ripe green fruit, brown sugar and sweet malt bring closure. A taste back in time, a realisation that not all single malts are equal and to achieve the absolute optimum, you must use barley that is made in Scotland. Make this one the benchmark for all others you meet on your journey through the stills of Scotland.FINISH Unforgettable! Its best enjoyed in good company, you just don¡¯t want the evening to end. It brings warmth to the heart and soul. The clock slows down and the cares of tomorrow disappear into the dawn.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

The classic, complex Bruichladdich dram, and the very first ¡°Eight¡± from this esteemed distillery. This ¡®new make¡¯ spirit sets out on its journey through life full of the crisp, fresh, malty flavours derived from trickle distillation. This is perfectly illustrated in the unpeated ¡®Laddie Eight¡¯, the latest exclusive for GTR released by head distiller Adam Hannett.
","¡°Character ¨C An elegant expression of Bruichladdich style. Super fruity and full of Atlantic freshness.Colour ¨C Lemon marmalade.Nose ¨C The opening notes are of fresh fruit, typical apple and pear slightly under ripe so characteristic of our spirit. Then pear drops apricot and pineapple in fruit syrup rise in the next wave. Vanilla oak is not far behind rolled in malted barley sugar and with a hint of straw. After a moment of warming the glass in your hand the floral tones of gorse and honeysuckle come through. The longer the whisky has to breathe the more you will find on the nose.Palate ¨C Spice gives way to sweetness as a pepperiness on the lips becomes mango and peach. Layer upon layer of oak from the variation of casks used to create this dram gives vanilla, lemon, honey, toffee and a creamy buttery texture and mouth feel. A second taste will bring hints of fruit, raspberry and strawberry for sure and a touch of citrus and orange marmalade. The complexity is a joy to taste as each style of toasting or charring of the barrels plays its part in bringing a depth of flavour you will be eager to explore. This dram has vitality, depth and mellowness all at once as the classic Bruichladdich DNA of soft fruit and floral elegance mix with exotic fruit from such a variety of amazing oak. The quality of our Scottish malted barley is evident as the sweet malt sugar holds all the fruit and oak together in wondrous harmony.Finish ¨C Fresh sea breeze, sweet floral heather honey and citrus bring this dram to a close, but like a typical island good- bye it¡¯s not cheerio straight away, there is still a word or two to be had as the finish extends into the night with a long lasting vanilla note that doesn¡¯t seem to end.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

This single malt scotch whisky has been crafted by master distiller Jim Mcewan from individually selected casks to showcase the classic, floral and elegant Bruichladdich house style. Unpeated, it is our signature bottling and the definitive Bruichladdich. Made from 100% Scottish barley, trickle distilled, then matured for its entire life by the shores of Lochindaal in premium American oak, it is a testament to the quality of our ingredients. This is authenticity. We believe barley matters.
","¡°CHARACTER: Smooth as pebbles in a pool. It¡¯s clean, fresh and lively with both the oak and the grain in perfect harmony.COLOUR: Sunlight on fields of early summer barleyNOSE: The bouquet is brilliant. Opening with barley sugar and a hint of mint before leading into the most wonderful notes of freshly cut wild flowers; buttercup, daisy, meadowsweet, myrtle, primrose and cherry blossom. The cleanliness of the spirit is remarkable. As the seconds tick by, more aromas rise from the glass, little zephyrs of spindrift and sea pinks reminding you that this spirit is matured exclusively by the sea. After some four or five minutes and with the addition of a little water, caramelisd fruits drift onto the scene; lemon drops and honey, tangerine and tablet.PALATE: The palate entry is so refined and refreshing, the sweet oak and the barley arriving together sending the taste buds into raptures. The fruits from distillation drift in on an Atlantic breeze and pop on the tongue like champagne bubbles. A combination of ripe green fruit, brown sugar and sweet malt bring closure. A taste back in time, a realisation that not all single malts are equal and to achieve the absolute optimum, you must use barley that is made in Scotland. Make this one the benchmark for all others you meet on your journey through the stills of Scotland.FINISH Unforgettable! Its best enjoyed in good company, you just don¡¯t want the evening to end. It brings warmth to the heart and soul. The clock slows down and the cares of tomorrow disappear into the dawn.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

","¡°Character ¨C An elegant expression of Bruichladdich style. Super fruity and full of Atlantic freshness.Colour ¨C Lemon marmalade.Nose ¨C The opening notes are of fresh fruit, typical apple and pear slightly under ripe so characteristic of our spirit. Then pear drops apricot and pineapple in fruit syrup rise in the next wave. Vanilla oak is not far behind rolled in malted barley sugar and with a hint of straw. After a moment of warming the glass in your hand the floral tones of gorse and honeysuckle come through. The longer the whisky has to breathe the more you will find on the nose.Palate ¨C Spice gives way to sweetness as a pepperiness on the lips becomes mango and peach. Layer upon layer of oak from the variation of casks used to create this dram gives vanilla, lemon, honey, toffee and a creamy buttery texture and mouth feel. A second taste will bring hints of fruit, raspberry and strawberry for sure and a touch of citrus and orange marmalade. The complexity is a joy to taste as each style of toasting or charring of the barrels plays its part in bringing a depth of flavour you will be eager to explore. This dram has vitality, depth and mellowness all at once as the classic Bruichladdich DNA of soft fruit and floral elegance mix with exotic fruit from such a variety of amazing oak. The quality of our Scottish malted barley is evident as the sweet malt sugar holds all the fruit and oak together in wondrous harmony.Finish ¨C Fresh sea breeze, sweet floral heather honey and citrus bring this dram to a close, but like a typical island good- bye it¡¯s not cheerio straight away, there is still a word or two to be had as the finish extends into the night with a long lasting vanilla note that doesn¡¯t seem to end.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

Royal Salute was created to mark the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II and has ever since been the official partner to all ceremonial Royal gun salutes at the Tower of London. The Tower of London is also guardian to the treasured Royal Regalia, the collection of the British monarchy's most precious possessions, including the Crown Jewels proudly worn at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Just as these Crown Jewels are carefully watched over the Tower of London, so too are Royal Salute's rare collection of precious casks, which are kept under lock at our Speyside Vault. It's only these 'jewels', our exceptional whiskies that are patiently matured for a quarter of a century, that are included in this powerful 25 Year Old expression to impart a depth of flavour that only time allows. The Treasured Blend continues Royal Salute's legacy of distinction for elegantly crafted Scotch whisky. The blend is housed in a beautifully crafted porcelain flagon enhanced with sophisticated gold detailing and adorned with a jewelled stopper.

Evan Williams is a smooth, easy to drink Bourbon named after Evan Williams who, in 1783, opened Kentucky¡¯s first commercial distillery along the banks of the Ohio River. Many years and barrels later, we¡¯re still producing Bourbon with the same time-honored methods that Evan Williams did years ago. Today, Evan Williams is the second largest selling Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey in the US and the world, distilled just a few blocks from the site where Evan himself built his distillery. Evan Williams Black is 86 proof and aged far longer than we are required to by law. That proof and age leads to a Bourbon that we are proud of, made our way, and that is always rich, smooth, and full of character.

","¡°NOSE: Amber. Very sweet. Initially it is all creme caramel, caramelised fruit sugars, wood sugar, toffee and fudge before some apple and peach come through. In time a charred note of bourbon with a pleasing dusty dryness. Has some power.PALATE: Sweet start and quite fat and though the alcohol gives a little tongue-tingling buzz the result is a good mid-palate weight. The dry distillery character is there still, but there is now depth to counter. Water slightly dismantles the different elements, but adds some dried mint.FINISH: Deep and dark.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

Glencadam Distillery is located about half a mile outside the ancient city and former Royal Burgh of Brechin in the kingdom of Angus in the eastern Highlands of Scotland.
The essential supply of pure water for distilling depends on Glencadam's long-held rights to springs, about half a mile away in the Unthank hills.
Glencadam has operated two pot stills since the beginning. An unusual feature about the stills is that their lye pipes run upwards at an angle of 15 degrees rather than downwards. The belief is that this helps to produce a particularly delicate and mellow spirit which after maturation yields sweet and fruity notes in the final product.

David was so inspired by the sherry bodegas of Spain that he designed a custom-built Solera Vat to add extra layers of smoothness and sweetness to the 15 Year Old expression. Eschewing the traditional, pyramid-style barrel construction, David drew on his 35 years of experience and understanding, as well as the knowledge passed down to him by previous generations of Malt Masters, to create something genuinely new. Being one of the oldest family-owned single malt distilleries in the world, Glenfiddich has carried its pioneering spirit through the generations. Malt Master, David Stewart, masterminded the Solera technique which makes its 15 Year Old expression so special. ***Due Note actual packaging may differ from image shown***

Exemplifying the family¡¯s tradition of innovation, our 15 Year Old expression is created using a technique pioneered by our Malt Master and its warm, spicy flavours are transformed with the alchemy of the Solera Vat. Many claim that the Glenfiddich 15 is the best edition of the Glenfiddich brand. The whiskey was aged in American bourbon barrels, Portuguese sherry barrels, and virgin oak barrels. Then the whiskey was married using the Solera method, which provides the whiskey with flavors of sweet sherry and a guaranteed and uniform quality in each and every bottle. The production and aging methods of the Glenfiddich 15 year old are the first of their kind in the world. The writing ""Solera"" in the name of the whiskey marks the aging method of the Spanish sherry, where in each stage a younger beverage is transferred into a barrels that already contains aged beverage. Aged in European oak sherry casks and new oak casks, the whisky is mellowed in our unique Solera Vat, a large oak tun inspired by the sherry bodegas of Spain and Portugal.

David was so inspired by the sherry bodegas of Spain that he designed a custom-built Solera Vat to add extra layers of smoothness and sweetness to the 15 Year Old expression. Eschewing the traditional, pyramid-style barrel construction, David drew on his 35 years of experience and understanding, as well as the knowledge passed down to him by previous generations of Malt Masters, to create something genuinely new. Being one of the oldest family-owned single malt distilleries in the world, Glenfiddich has carried its pioneering spirit through the generations. Malt Master, David Stewart, masterminded the Solera technique which makes its 15 Year Old expression so special. ***Due Note actual packaging may differ from image shown***

Exemplifying the family¡¯s tradition of innovation, our 15 Year Old expression is created using a technique pioneered by our Malt Master and its warm, spicy flavours are transformed with the alchemy of the Solera Vat. Many claim that the Glenfiddich 15 is the best edition of the Glenfiddich brand. The whiskey was aged in American bourbon barrels, Portuguese sherry barrels, and virgin oak barrels. Then the whiskey was married using the Solera method, which provides the whiskey with flavors of sweet sherry and a guaranteed and uniform quality in each and every bottle. The production and aging methods of the Glenfiddich 15 year old are the first of their kind in the world. The writing ""Solera"" in the name of the whiskey marks the aging method of the Spanish sherry, where in each stage a younger beverage is transferred into a barrels that already contains aged beverage. Aged in European oak sherry casks and new oak casks, the whisky is mellowed in our unique Solera Vat, a large oak tun inspired by the sherry bodegas of Spain and Portugal.

Elegant but full bodied this whisky has spent ten years maturing in American white oak ex-bourbon casks before being extra-matured for a further two years in Oloroso and PX Sherry casks from Jerez in Spain. Lasanta is Gaelic for warmth and passion, a reminder not just of the Spanish provenance of these Oloroso sherry butts, but also a reflection of this expression's lusciously soft texture and deep, enticingly sweet aroma.

A very interesting whisky from Glenmorangie, its first made with barley kilned with botanicals. Inspired by the woodlands near Glenmorangie¡¯s director of whisky creation Dr Bill Lumsden¡¯s home, he decided to make a dram that would evoke the scents, sounds, and sights of the forest.
Kilning barley with botanicals used to be a common practice and Glenmorangie revived it here after a series of experiments. Juniper berries, birch bark, and heather flowers, as well as a little peat were used to kiln the barley to create a Glenmorangie ¡°as lush and leafy as the forest itself¡±, in Dr. Lumsden¡¯s words. In order to allow the spirit¡¯s flavours to shine, he aged the whisky in bourbon casks including many refill casks.

Glenmorangie distillery lies coastline of Easter Ross. The distillery has only sixteen distillery workers ¨C two for each of its eight stills. These stills are the tallest found in the Highlands, of the same design as those used in the 1880¡¯s which were actually second-hand gin stills. Their height means that only the purest vapours reach their necks and condense. The owners Macdonald and Muir take great care in cask selection, using US oak from the Osark mountains. The ¡®designer hogsheads¡¯ which they began to use in 1995 (when the charming Mr Bill Lumsden arrived at the company) are now showing dividends in the wonderful Artisan Cask. They also use a hard water source, which is unusual. The Glenmorangie Nectar D¡¯Or is a beautifully fresh whisky, finished in Barriques from the Sauternes region of France.

A very interesting whisky from Glenmorangie, its first made with barley kilned with botanicals. Inspired by the woodlands near Glenmorangie¡¯s director of whisky creation Dr Bill Lumsden¡¯s home, he decided to make a dram that would evoke the scents, sounds, and sights of the forest.
Kilning barley with botanicals used to be a common practice and Glenmorangie revived it here after a series of experiments. Juniper berries, birch bark, and heather flowers, as well as a little peat were used to kiln the barley to create a Glenmorangie ¡°as lush and leafy as the forest itself¡±, in Dr. Lumsden¡¯s words. In order to allow the spirit¡¯s flavours to shine, he aged the whisky in bourbon casks including many refill casks.

Glenmorangie distillery lies coastline of Easter Ross. The distillery has only sixteen distillery workers ¨C two for each of its eight stills. These stills are the tallest found in the Highlands, of the same design as those used in the 1880¡¯s which were actually second-hand gin stills. Their height means that only the purest vapours reach their necks and condense. The owners Macdonald and Muir take great care in cask selection, using US oak from the Osark mountains. The ¡®designer hogsheads¡¯ which they began to use in 1995 (when the charming Mr Bill Lumsden arrived at the company) are now showing dividends in the wonderful Artisan Cask. They also use a hard water source, which is unusual. The Glenmorangie Nectar D¡¯Or is a beautifully fresh whisky, finished in Barriques from the Sauternes region of France. The wine influence is apparent in the velvety lemon and honey notes.

Haig Whisky is the oldest of all scotch whiskies and may even be the oldest whisky in the world. Haig whisky is steeped in history since it was first distilled by John Haig in Cameronbridge Scotland in 1824. From these humble beginnings Haig Whisky quickly rose to become one of the most successful and popular Scotch whiskies in the world before falling into decline some 30 years ago as it left the Haig family ownership and was passed through a series of multinational drinks companies. The original distillery in Cameronbridge meanwhile went from strength to strength and now, in the ownership of Diageo, is one of the largest distilleries in Europe. Haig Dimple was named after the unique shape of the Dimple bottle.
","¡°Nose: Toffee and Spice with a slight citrus edge. A little water can help to open the nose further.Taste: Surprisingly rough at first but quickly settling to a warm slightly smokey taste at the back of the mouth with an underlying caramel sweetness.Finish: A fairly short finish of burnt fudge or caramel with a hint of oak in the background.Haig Dimple is a fast disappearing part of whisky history. I have laid down a couple of bottles myself for posterity. All of the bottles on our online Haig Whisky shop date from the 40¡¯s 50¡¯s and 60¡¯s, so you really are in touch with the Spitfire to Madmen whisky generation.

Hauana Club A?ejo 7 A?os was brought to the world by legendary Maestro Ronero Don Jose Navarro. It was customary for the Maestro to drink Extra aged rums at the distillery but it was Don Jose Navarro who decided to share this very style of rum with the rest of the world. Some rums are made to be mixed, this style was made to be savoured neat. Putting to good use the tradition and the skills previous generations of Maestros handed down to him, Navarro blended and aged his nectar over numerous cycles in order to create a very complex rum with a wealth of flavours that remains incredibly easy to enjoy neat.
","¡°So what does Hauana Club A?ejo 7 A?os taste like? It's a simple answer: just like a fine wine, it's the taste of the terroir that comes through, from the world famous tobacco, to the rich and sweet fruits of a garden to spices and vanilla flavour brought by long ageing.  And you can even taste the raw material used to make the rum: Sugarcane. Coat the sides of the glass with the rum, then shake it off to discard the last drops, leave it to dry and then, after 20 minutes, smell.  Only a a great rum leaves off aromas in a glass for a such a long time.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

It is created at the Hendrick¡¯s Gin Palace on the Ayrshire bee corridor, this gin was inspired?by Ms. Lesley Gracie¡¯s fascination in watching nature at the Gin Palace garden.
Specifically her fascination with enticing flowers and the interaction with garden creatures.
Ms. Gracie has a deep rooted love and respect for nature and the importance of protecting unique and precious eco systems. Using her background in chemistry, experience of experimentation, and fascination with botanical pairings, Ms. Gracie has extracted this enticing essence and bottled it in a gin.
Hendrick¡¯s Flora Adora is based on the signature round house style made by curiously combining 11 botanicals distilled in two unusual stills and adding the delicious duo rose and cucumber as a coupe de grace, but Hendrick¡¯s Flora Adora adds yet another wave of flavour using a secret selection of flowers particularly attractive to pollinators to create an enticingly fresh, lusciously floral gin.

In 1895, Jack began bottling his?Tennessee Whiskey in his iconic square bottle. Two years after Jack¡¯s decision, the government passed the Bottled in Bond Act. The Act certified the quality of any whiskey carrying an official designation on the bottle. To earn this distinction, a whiskey had to be distilled at a single distillery during a single distilling season, aged at least four years and be bottled at 100 proof. 120 years later, the Bottled in Bond Act is proof of America¡¯s commitment to ensuring the quality of whiskey.

In 1895, Jack began bottling his?Tennessee Whiskey in his iconic square bottle. Two years after Jack¡¯s decision, the government passed the Bottled in Bond Act. The Act certified the quality of any whiskey carrying an official designation on the bottle. To earn this distinction, a whiskey had to be distilled at a single distillery during a single distilling season, aged at least four years and be bottled at 100 proof. 120 years later, the Bottled in Bond Act is proof of America¡¯s commitment to ensuring the quality of whiskey.

In 1820, John Walker started out in business with a single small shop, but he always had big ambitions. Just over a century later, John Walker & Sons was awarded a Royal Warrant by King George V. By then, Johnnie Walker was already well on its way to becoming the world¡¯s most popular Scotch Whisky. Becoming a supplier to the Royal Household was an important step on that journey. John Walker & Sons King George V commemorates the granting of the Royal Warrant on 1 January 1934. It is created using only the finest whiskies from distilleries that were operating during George¡¯s twenty-five-year reign (1910 ¨C 1936), some of which, like the famed Port Ellen, no longer exist. They are blended together to reflect the distinctive Johnnie Walker style of the era.
","¡°It is an opulent and regal blend. Sensuous, layered and intense, the John Walker & Sons King George V is a kaleidoscope of flavours and aromas. Hints of roasted nuts, dark chocolate and an imposing sweet smokiness combine elegantly with suggestions of honey, citrus orange and rose petals.

Crafted from a palette of Speyside, Highland, Lowland and Island malts and matured for at least 15 years, it delivers all the character of a single malt whisky, but with a greater depth of flavour.

Johnnie Walker Red Label was launched in its current form by brothers George and Alexander Walker in 1909, though it had existed as Walker's Special Old Highland Red Label for some years previously. Alexander blended a type of whisky which is more suited to mixing with soda than the heavier, more old-fashioned whiskies, and named it after his grandfather, who had started the family business in 1820. Today it is the world's most popular whisky and is sold in more than 200 markets world-wide.

Knob Creek Bourbon was named after a little creek that runs just south of the distillery, the same creek that ran by Abraham Lincoln's childhood home. The bottle embodies the handmade look and feel of the turn-of-the century bourbon as well. It is reminiscent of a bootlegger's flask with newspaper scrawled on the label, harkening back to the decade's old custom of wrapping bottles in newspaper at the distillery.

There¡¯s no faking full bourbon flavor. It has to be earned. So that¡¯s what we do in Clermont: we earn it. We start by selecting the finest grains. And we finish by meticulously aging our whiskey in white oak barrels with maximum char, for an unmistakable richness and signature sweetness. It¡¯s the natural way. And there¡¯s just no cheating nature.

Single malt whiskey, from the island Islay in Scotland. The whiskey is aged for 16 years in oak barrels that were previously used to age sherry, and offers highly dominant smoky and peaty flavors. Lagavulin 16 is the main component in the Johnnie Walker Red blend.
","¡°Lagavulin distillery is located on the island Islay in south-west Scotland ¨C one of the five whiskey production regions in the country. Today there are 8 active distilleries on the island. Due to the richness in seaweed and peat in that region, combined with its unique stormy weather, the whiskey style is characterized as smoky, peaty, with a very strong and rich flavor.¡±","If you find the Macallans enjoyable and the Glenfiddichs smooth, this is nothing like that. The Lagavulin 16 is a complex whisky, smoky and peaty and smells of bbq charcoal and burnt barley. The whisky however, tastes better than it smells. There are subtle citrus notes as it goes down and lingering smoked barley in the aftertaste.
The Lagavulin 16 is very rich and powering, particularly if you like the smokey, peaty type of whisky. Worth a try if you want something different from the norms.Try watering down 3 drops (best) or 5 to 6 drops tops. You can smell very light vanilla sweetness between 3 to 6 drops. More than that, the sweetness starts to fade. The most intense flavors from tasting come with 3 to 4 drops of water. Let the whisky linger in your mouth for 10 - 15 secs and you can experience the change in flavors.

Left to rest in first-fill, over-charred ex-bourbon barrels before further maturing in large, new European oak hogsheads never before used by Laphroaig, maturation occurs slowly, resulting in a whisky of great depth.

Today, 20% of the barley used by the distillery is still malted and dried on-site at up to 40-60 ppm phenols. The remaining 80% comes from the Port Ellen maltings, at 35-45 ppm phenols. Full of inspiration, in just a fraction of a second, this bottling takes us to Laphroaig to breathe in the particularly invigorating salty sea air. Next, acting as a link between the peat and the other ingredients of the aroma and flavour palette, incredibly smooth dark chocolate brings us irresistibly towards the malting floors filled with the utterly divine fragrances of germinating barley.

On the far edge of the Scotch whisky map, it's supposed that the art of distillation was first brought to Islay by Irish monks. Being remote, it¡¯s an art that flourished in the hands of the islanders, whose illegal operations tested the resolve and means of the tax man. Eventually, the law relaxed, various whisky makers set up legitimate distilleries, among them a pair of farmers, Donald and Alexander Johnston, who in 1815 founded their distillery on the island¡¯s south coast. Laphroaig, so called after its location, ¡®broad hollow by the bay.¡¯ It would remain in family hands for the next 139 years.

Laphroaig Quarter Cask offers an irresistible doubling of flavour, due to the double maturation in two barrels made of American oak. Still-maturing whisky from our standard ex-bourbon barrels is transferred to quarter casks and left to rest in our warehouse just a stone¡¯s throw from the Atlantic shore. This process represents Laphroaig breathing new life into a once-defunct tradition: the use of the smaller cask size, which ensures increased contact with the oak, creating a soft and velvety edge to complement Laphroaig¡¯s distinctive peatiness. On the nose the sensation is toffee and caramel, caused by the vanillas and tannins of the American oak, plus a dryness from the wood oil. The finish is long and alternates between this sweetness and smoke.

Laphroaig Select takes its name from the special selection of American and European casks, chosen for their unique character that they give during maturation. Our Inspiration for their new Global expression has been take from history ¨C 70-80 years ago, the time of the last family member owner of the distillery, Ian Hunter. Ian was one of the biggest influences in the history of Laphroaig indeed he was one of the first distillers to travel to bourbon county in the USA to identify new sources of casks that would give him greater consistency as well as new flavours. He later married this ¡®new¡¯ style of Laphroaig with his traditionally matured (European cask) Laphroaig. Inspired by his early work , they have used Oloroso sherry butts, straight American white oak (non-filled with bourbon), PX seasoned hogsheads, Quarter Casks and finally of course first fill Bourbon Casks. This varied cask maturation technique enabled us to create 6 new flavour combinations that were then tested with our FOL¡¯s to choose their favourite style and indeed name. The winning flavour and name chosen by you is LAPHROAIG SELECT.
","¡°COLOUR: A Fully Natural colour with no caramel added, it is sparkling gold with layers of colour ¨C arising from different maturations and oils mixing together.NOSE: Peat first, then ripe red fruits from the PX and Oloroso casks. A hint of dryness next from the American oak with a long lingering florally finish - Marzipan and even limes at the end.PALATE: This full bodied whisky is initially sweet up front- matching the nose, then the classic dry, peaty, ashy flavours come bounding in followed by a lovely rich finish arising from the rich fruits of the European casks.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

This union reveals an unmatched investment in time and extraordinary commitment to mastery for which The Macallan has been known since 1824.

This one changed the way we think of bourbon, all because one man changed the way he thought about making it. Bill Samuels, Sr., simply wanted a whisky he would enjoy drinking. Never bitter or sharp, Maker's Mark is made with soft red winter wheat, instead of the usual rye, for a one-of-a-kind, full-flavored bourbon that's easy to drink. To ensure consistency, we rotate every barrel by hand and age our bourbon to taste, not time. Each and every bottle of Maker's is still hand-dipped in our signature red wax at our distillery in Loretto, Ky., just like Bill, Sr., would have wanted.

This one changed the way we think of bourbon, all because one man changed the way he thought about making it. Bill Samuels, Sr., simply wanted a whisky he would enjoy drinking. Never bitter or sharp, Maker's Mark is made with soft red winter wheat, instead of the usual rye, for a one-of-a-kind, full-flavored bourbon that's easy to drink. To ensure consistency, we rotate every barrel by hand and age our bourbon to taste, not time. Each and every bottle of Maker's is still hand-dipped in our signature red wax at our distillery in Loretto, Ky., just like Bill, Sr., would have wanted.

Convention said Blended Malt matured and got its flavour from pre-used Bourbon casks. This got us thinking, what if instead we used first-fill sherry casks to add another layer of rich and fruity flavour to our unique blend of single malts? These are casks that have never held whisky, Naked Casks we call them. This liberating leap into the unknown didn¡¯t just work, it was a joyful exuberance of flavour, that changed the possibilities of whisky enjoyment! In fact from this sprung a whole ¡®Live Naked¡¯ ethos, celebrating freedom; that liberating moment of release when you drop the act and can get back to the real you, the Naked you. Tie off, bra off, laptop shut! Naked Grouse gives you the freedom to enjoy things your way. It¡¯s best for those liberating moments when only a blended malt will do. Live differently¡­ Live Naked!

                  Within this stunning bottle lies a stunning sake, packed full of surprises. Brewed with a 'low-intervention' style, the final product does not go through the usual charcoal filtering (Muroka) or dilution with water (Genshu), resulting in fresh apple on the nose and a rich, complex, full flavour.

This junmai sake brewed entirely with Gohyakumangoku sake rice is made with the traditional kimoto method used since the Edo period, which skillfully enables the workings of yeast and lactic acid bacteria. The result is a brew that's uniquely complex and concentrated, yet smooth and elegant.

                  Smirnoff No. 21 is the world's No. 1 vodka. Its classic taste has inspired other varieties throughout all four corners of the globe.

The Smirnoff brand was founded in 1864 by Piotr Arseneevich Smirnov and before long, he became one of the most famous vodka makers in Russia. In 1886, he even received the Tsar¡¯s special designation as a Purveyor of the Imperial Court, which is a fancy way of saying Official Vodka-Maker of Tsar Type People. This was based both on the fact that his vodkas were delicious and that Tsars tend to like to make things official.

When the Bolsheviks took over, the distilleries were shut down and P.A.¡¯s son Vladimir was chased out of town with pitchforks and also dinner forks, since the whole thing happened suddenly and not everyone had a pitchfork with them.

Vladimir Smirnov was able to flee to Constantinople and then eventually settle in France where he sold vodka under the name ¡°Smirnoff.¡± Now safely disguised by a new name and a slightly offensive fake French accent, Vladimir revived the brand.

Southern Comfort was produced in 1874 by a bartender who believed that drinking whiskey should be an enjoyable experience, and not one you should suffer from. He mixed whiskey with a mixture of fruits and spices he had formulated, and created a delicious drink that slides down the throat. Today the Southern Comfort is produced from a natural cereal distillate and a mixture of whiskey, vanilla, sugar, cinnamon and various fruits, first and foremost the peach.
","¡°The liqueur recommended for serving in a lowball glass or as a base for popular cocktails such as Alabama Slammer, Sex on the Beach and more.¡±","It's Sweet and sweeter in memory; Souththern Comfort was introduced to me by an old friend back in 1990/91, those were years of lots of great moments with friends in music. I drink Southern Comfort straight, neat or with a cube of ice. Recently I mixed it with a jig of Wild Turkey 101 and it's really nice. Spicy sweet and the alcohol hit was nice slow warm rise with no headaches the next day. But this is just me; try it out yourself, try out someone's memory lane drink.

Produced from the best aniseed and grapes of Turkey, with its soft palate and unique taste, Tekirdag Raki has gained the admiration of all raki lovers, including female consumers.The story of Tekirdag Raki begins with the grape and aniseed that is used in its production arriving at the distillery. After the fresh grapes and raisins are cut into pieces in the cutting machines they are placed in tanks with water, and sira, the grape juice, is prepared. Pure yeast is added to the sira placed in tanks to start alcoholic fermentation. This process produces the ¡®suma', which carries the unique aroma of grapes which have been distilled until the alcohol content is 94,5 %.The mixture is then placed in traditional five thousand litre copper alembics and aniseed with high essential oil content is added, the quantity of which is determined by the oil content. The next stage is the isolation of the mid-product, which has the ideal softness and drinking characteristics. The raki experts of Mey remove the head and tail product at just the right levels, and, following a second distillation, place the mid-product in oak barrels to rest for a period that ranges from 20 days to 3-4 months. Filtered for one last time before being bottled, the Tekirdag Raki is now ready to set out for its esteemed place on raki tables.

A symbol of Sorrentine gastronomy, a Campanian product par excellence and a Mediterranean masterpiece that is known and loved all around the world. This is limoncello, also known as limoncino, a sweet liqueur that was invented at the end of the nineteenth century as an alcoholic drink, made by skilfully blending lemons, sugar, water and alcohol together. Limoncello is a natural artisanal product -- made by infusing the peels of Sorrento Oval PGI lemons, before adding water and sugar. This powerful and unique raw ingredient, which has its luscious fragrance infused into the alcohol, with a natural, traditional and simple production process, make Sorrento¡¯s traditional limoncello a symbol of Neapolitan food and drink. Limoncello can be enjoyed on many family occasions and with friends, usually enjoyed as a refreshing digest if served in a chilled shot glass after meals, which is a stylish source of inspiration for everyone who loves great food! However, that authentic Mediterranean flavour, the quality of the basic ingredients and its refined style mean that Villa Massa offers novel ways of appreciating limoncello, for the preparation of elegant cocktails that can include creatively rearranged Mediterranean flavours.
","¡°Villa Massa¡¯s Limoncello has a distinct colour - a vibrant green with hints of bright yellow and white which is the result of a long infusion process that enables the lemon¡¯s bright yellow pigment to naturally infuse into the liquor. When you taste Villa Massa, you immediately discover its unique fragrance of the lemon. It tastes so intense and refreshing that it transports you immediately to a lemon grove with views out over the Gulf of Naples. Its natural flavour delicately cleanses the palate, creating the perfect balance between the acidic lemony notes, the sweet notes and the alcoholic base. The traditional way to enjoy limoncello is chilled to -7¡ã in a chilled shot glass. However, you can also get a sense of the superior quality of Villa Massa by tasting it at room temperature, or by using it in Mediterranean-style cocktails .¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

The traditional Limoncello of Sorrento is produced by Villa Massa using an old family recipe. It is precisely the respect for tradition and the scrupulous care of the raw materials used that make this company international leader in the production of Limoncello for over twenty years. The real Limoncello of Sorrento is, in fact, produced ??using lemons grown only in one of the towns of the Sorrentine Peninsula, and in the island of Capri. Limoncello (also known as Limoncino) is a sweet lemon liqueur born, according to tradition, at the end of the nineteenth century, as an alcoholic beverage made by expertly blending lemons, sugar and alcohol. The geographic origins of Limoncello, a typical enogastronomical product from the Campania region, were lost among different traditions.

A symbol of Sorrentine gastronomy, a Campanian product par excellence and a Mediterranean masterpiece that is known and loved all around the world. This is limoncello, also known as limoncino, a sweet liqueur that was invented at the end of the nineteenth century as an alcoholic drink, made by skilfully blending lemons, sugar, water and alcohol together. Limoncello is a natural artisanal product -- made by infusing the peels of Sorrento Oval PGI lemons, before adding water and sugar. This powerful and unique raw ingredient, which has its luscious fragrance infused into the alcohol, with a natural, traditional and simple production process, make Sorrento¡¯s traditional limoncello a symbol of Neapolitan food and drink. Limoncello can be enjoyed on many family occasions and with friends, usually enjoyed as a refreshing digest if served in a chilled shot glass after meals, which is a stylish source of inspiration for everyone who loves great food! However, that authentic Mediterranean flavour, the quality of the basic ingredients and its refined style mean that Villa Massa offers novel ways of appreciating limoncello, for the preparation of elegant cocktails that can include creatively rearranged Mediterranean flavours.
","¡°Villa Massa¡¯s Limoncello has a distinct colour - a vibrant green with hints of bright yellow and white which is the result of a long infusion process that enables the lemon¡¯s bright yellow pigment to naturally infuse into the liquor. When you taste Villa Massa, you immediately discover its unique fragrance of the lemon. It tastes so intense and refreshing that it transports you immediately to a lemon grove with views out over the Gulf of Naples. Its natural flavour delicately cleanses the palate, creating the perfect balance between the acidic lemony notes, the sweet notes and the alcoholic base. The traditional way to enjoy limoncello is chilled to -7¡ã in a chilled shot glass. However, you can also get a sense of the superior quality of Villa Massa by tasting it at room temperature, or by using it in Mediterranean-style cocktails .¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

The traditional Limoncello of Sorrento is produced by Villa Massa using an old family recipe. It is precisely the respect for tradition and the scrupulous care of the raw materials used that make this company international leader in the production of Limoncello for over twenty years. The real Limoncello of Sorrento is, in fact, produced ??using lemons grown only in one of the towns of the Sorrentine Peninsula, and in the island of Capri. Limoncello (also known as Limoncino) is a sweet lemon liqueur born, according to tradition, at the end of the nineteenth century, as an alcoholic beverage made by expertly blending lemons, sugar and alcohol. The geographic origins of Limoncello, a typical enogastronomical product from the Campania region, were lost among different traditions.

It¡¯s the sweeter, smoother side of Wild Turkey, with notes of sweet honey, caramel, and orange. All bourbon is whiskey, but not all whiskey is bourbon. Bourbon tastes stronger and sweeter than other whiskeys. That¡¯s because it¡¯s distilled from a key ingredient: corn. Bourbon is America¡¯s native spirit, and 95% of it comes from Kentucky. To call your bourbon Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey it must be aged in new, charred oak barrels for at least 2 years and be made in Kentucky.

Jimmy Russell created American Honey nearly four decades ago, adding Pure Honey to the same bourbon he stubbornly kept consistent for over 60 years.

It¡¯s the sweeter, smoother side of Wild Turkey, with notes of sweet honey, caramel, and orange. All bourbon is whiskey, but not all whiskey is bourbon. Bourbon tastes stronger and sweeter than other whiskeys. That¡¯s because it¡¯s distilled from a key ingredient: corn. Bourbon is America¡¯s native spirit, and 95% of it comes from Kentucky. To call your bourbon Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey it must be aged in new, charred oak barrels for at least 2 years and be made in Kentucky.

Expect pineapple, orange peels and gentle nutmeg on the nose, before the palate arrives with sweet honey, creamy coconut and subtle hints of blueberry. Then comes the magnificent finish, topping things off in style with notes of vanilla, ginger and gentle smoke.

                  Johnnie Walker commemorates Singapore¡¯s 56th National Day with an exclusively designed Johnnie Walker Blue Label limited edition. Featuring a curated selection of unique Singapore icons, this one-of-a-kind design is digitally printed on the bottle. With a limited quantity of only 200 bottles for sale, this special launch serves as a perfect gift to celebrate with family and friends as we mark our nation¡¯s progress. 

The design pays loving homage to the beauty of Singapore¡¯s landscapes and icons through its heritage and their respective stories- capturing the unique intersection of new and old, tradition and culture. Each side of the bottle presents a facet of Singapore, juxtapositioning modern and historical as a portrait of Singapore's truly unique qualities. Aside from this, the artwork also consists of boat and port related symbols that are strongly associated with Singapore, relating to the country's role as a trading port since it's early days. As for more quirky additions such as the otter, a more recent repopulated animal of the last decade, it represents one of the recognisable and adored animals that Singaporeans can call their own. For an extra special touch, unique numbering will be placed on each bottle to signify this special collaboration.

On the box packaging, a special holographic sticker is placed on each box with a custom artwork of the Singapore skyline. Each bottle also comes with a signature Johnnie Walker Blue Label crystal glass, in a specially designed box to match the bottle design.

Johnnie Walker Blue Label is a velvety smooth whisky with a remarkable depth of character. Inside every bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue Label are remarkably rare handpicked single malt and grain whiskies from the four corners of Scotland ¨C each bringing unique flavours and distinctive character of their own.

Only 1 in 10,000 casks in our unparalleled reserves of over 10 million maturing Scotch Whiskies has the richness and character required to intricately craft Johnnie Walker Blue Label. Mature, older whiskies, including irreplaceable casks from long-closed ¡®ghost¡¯ distilleries, are selected for their smoothness and deep flavours - rich fruits, smoke and refined vanilla sweetness. When they are perfectly balanced with younger, more vibrant whiskies they open up, bringing layers of effervescent flavour to this remarkable Scotch. It¡¯s a whisky like no other.

                  Absolut Vodka was first launched in New York in 1979. It soon became the talk of the town, in the US and eventually of the world. But the recipe behind the clean and natural taste of Absolut is actually older than 30 years. So is the 18th century medicine bottle found in an antique store in Stockholm, Sweden that gave inspiration to the iconic Absolut Vodka bottle.
                ","¡°The main ingredients in Absolut Vodka are water and winter wheat. The water comes from a deep well in ?hus where it¡¯s protected from impurities. Winter wheat differs from other crops: it¡¯s sown in fall, and harvested the next one. Days in between it grows under the Swedish snow developing its hard grain. Also, the use of fertilizers is minimized.¡±","Good, clean vodka that mixes well and is easy to drink.",,,,,Spirit,[]

Even though Amaretto is known as an almond-based liqueur, the Disaronno (from the town ""Saronno"" in Italy) does not contain almonds at all.

The Disaronno, is a secret recipe dating back from 1525. It is known as the oldest Amaretto brand in the world and it is only produced in Saronno to this day.

                  Absolut Vodka was first launched in New York in 1979. It soon became the talk of the town, in the US and eventually of the world. But the recipe behind the clean and natural taste of Absolut is actually older than 30 years. So is the 18th century medicine bottle found in an antique store in Stockholm, Sweden that gave inspiration to the iconic Absolut Vodka bottle.
                ","¡°The main ingredients in Absolut Vodka are water and winter wheat. The water comes from a deep well in ?hus where it¡¯s protected from impurities. Winter wheat differs from other crops: it¡¯s sown in fall, and harvested the next one. Days in between it grows under the Swedish snow developing its hard grain. Also, the use of fertilizers is minimized.¡±","Good, clean vodka that mixes well and is easy to drink.",,,,,Spirit,[]

The story behind the name Absolut Kurant is black currant, a typical Swedish berry from which the flavor is taken. When launched in 1992 it was a tribute to the Swedish origin of Absolut Vodka. Originally it was even supposed to be called Absolut Vinb?r since the Swedish word for black currant is vinb?r. Only thing was that the English pronunciation would have been wine bar.

To make The Balvenie DoubleWood, David Stewart MBE takes whisky that has spent at least 12 years in traditional whisky casks, American Oak ex-bourbon barrels and hogsheads, and moves it to Spanish oak ex-Oloroso sherry casks for an additional nine months. The whisky is then transferred to large oak vessels called ¡°tuns¡± for 3-4 months to allow the whiskies to ¡°marry¡±. Each stage lends different qualities to the resulting single malt whisky. The traditional casks soften and add delicate character, the sherry wood brings depth and fullness of flavour and the final few months in our tuns allow the whiskies to marry harmoniously. The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 year old single malt whisky gains its distinctive character from being matured in two wood types.

The Balvenie Caribbean Cask 14 year old single malt whisky has been matured in traditional oak whisky casks for 14 years, and then ¡®finished¡¯ in casks that previously held Caribbean rum. To create the ideal finish Malt Master David C. Stewart MBE filled American oak casks with his own blend of select West Indian rums. When he judged the casks to be ready, the rum was replaced with the 14 year old spirit and the wood was put to work adding the final touches. The result is an exceptional single malt whisky with the traditional smooth, honeyed character of The Balvenie married with notes of toffee and a hint of fruit, with a warm, lingering finish.

The Balvenie Peat Week Aged 14 Years (2003 Vintage) is the result of trials undertaken in 2001 by The Balvenie Malt Master David C. Stewart MBE and our former distillery manager Ian Millar. At a time when few Speyside distilleries were using peat in production, The Balvenie decided to distil a batch of heavily peated malt, which was laid down to mature at the distillery in Dufftown, Scotland. Ever since then we¡¯ve dedicated one week each year, named Peat Week, to using 100% Highland peat to dry our barley. Instead of coastal elements of iodine, salt and medicinal characteristics so commonly associated with Islay peat, Highland peat imparts earthy, woody smoke notes.

To make The Balvenie DoubleWood, David Stewart MBE takes whisky that has spent at least 12 years in traditional whisky casks, American Oak ex-bourbon barrels and hogsheads, and moves it to Spanish oak ex-Oloroso sherry casks for an additional nine months. The whisky is then transferred to large oak vessels called ¡°tuns¡± for 3-4 months to allow the whiskies to ¡°marry¡±. Each stage lends different qualities to the resulting single malt whisky. The traditional casks soften and add delicate character, the sherry wood brings depth and fullness of flavour and the final few months in our tuns allow the whiskies to marry harmoniously. The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 year old single malt whisky gains its distinctive character from being matured in two wood types.

The Balvenie Caribbean Cask 14 year old single malt whisky has been matured in traditional oak whisky casks for 14 years, and then ¡®finished¡¯ in casks that previously held Caribbean rum. To create the ideal finish Malt Master David C. Stewart MBE filled American oak casks with his own blend of select West Indian rums. When he judged the casks to be ready, the rum was replaced with the 14 year old spirit and the wood was put to work adding the final touches. The result is an exceptional single malt whisky with the traditional smooth, honeyed character of The Balvenie married with notes of toffee and a hint of fruit, with a warm, lingering finish.

The Balvenie Peat Week Aged 14 Years (2003 Vintage) is the result of trials undertaken in 2001 by The Balvenie Malt Master David C. Stewart MBE and our former distillery manager Ian Millar. At a time when few Speyside distilleries were using peat in production, The Balvenie decided to distil a batch of heavily peated malt, which was laid down to mature at the distillery in Dufftown, Scotland. Ever since then we¡¯ve dedicated one week each year, named Peat Week, to using 100% Highland peat to dry our barley. Instead of coastal elements of iodine, salt and medicinal characteristics so commonly associated with Islay peat, Highland peat imparts earthy, woody smoke notes. This means that even though Peat Week is made using heavily peated malt (30ppm) it has an unexpected sweetness deeply rooted in the Speyside regional character. The Balvenie Peat Week Aged 14 Years (2003 Vintage) is a single vintage bottling, limited and rare by nature. This non-chill filtered expression is bottled at 48.3% ABV and matured solely in American Oak casks, providing a velvety and round taste with woody peat smoke balancing oaky vanilla and honey.

                  Beluga is a world famous noble Russian vodka. Thanks to its aristocratic origins and idyllic quality, Beluga has claimed its rightful place in the global culture of spirit satisfaction and consumption.

Water is the key component in the production of Beluga vodka, accounting for 60% of its unique formula. It comes from 300-meter deep artesian wells in the bedrock of Siberia. Another principal component in the Beluga recipe is a special malt spirit rarely found today in regular vodka, mainly due to its cost and the labor-intensive production technologies it requires. Yet, there is another important secret in Beluga's recipe: its production cycle includes a final, conclusive phase - maturation. Depending on the vodka's grade it may last from one to three months.

                  The collector's line of Beluga Transatlantic Racing is crafted in honor of The Russian Yachting Team, which has achieved brilliant victories at a number of prestigious competitions in the Mediterranean and Atlantic Regattas. The recipe of this kind of Beluga differs from other vodkas in the Beluga constellation: In the process of filtration, the spirit passes through natural cotton.

The resting period is increased to 45 days, making its taste even more delicate. Such treatment results in a fresh aftertaste and the elite smoothness of Beluga Transatlantic Racing. The bottle's design clearly reflects marine motifs: The label features a golden anchor on a deep navy-blue background. There is also a little Beluga fish on the bottle's neck in shiny gold.

                  The incredible story of B¨¦n¨¦dictine began in 1510 in the Abbey of F¨¦camp, in Normandy, France, when the Benedictine monk, Dom Bernardo Vincelli, created a secret elixir that was to become famous for years to come.

Three hundred and fifty years later, in 1863, Alexandre Le Grand, a merchant and collector of religious art, discovered the lost recipe for this elixir in his collection. Intrigued by the discovery and after many attempts, he successfully recreated the mysterious liqueur that he called B¨¦n¨¦dictine.

Distilled and aged in a flamboyant palace, built in F¨¦camp in tribute to this unique liqueur, B¨¦n¨¦dictine is a subtle alchemy of 27 different plants and spices.

Octomore 10.2 edition has spent the first four years of its life in fresh bourbon barrels, before being moved into exceptionally high quality, and incredibly rare Sauternes casks. The reputable chateau who originally managed these casks had filled them three times over with French sweet wine, allowing the oak to mellow and therefore temper its influence in our subsequent spirit. The combination of the softer smoke and oak influence has created a sublime balance with tropical fruit notes.

In Victorian times, when Bruichladdich Distillery was built, all Scottish barley was organically grown. The relationship between distiller, farmer and soil was intimate and enduring. These ties were lost as industrialised farming cut through ancient synergies and an age of super efficient blandness was born. In partnership with our organic farmers ¨C Sir William Roberts of Mains of Tullibardine, William Rose at Mid Coull and Neil Scobie at Coulmore ¨C we are rediscovering these synergies.

Bowmore 12 Year Old has received much critical acclaim; the late, great whisky writer Michael Jackson proclaimed it ""remarkably long and complex"". We like to think of it as vanilla ice cream at a beach bonfire. Comes with miniatures of Bowmore No 1 and 15 Year No 1 - With more maturing history within its walls than anywhere else in Scotland, Bowmore No.1 malt will unlock the door to a story of deeper character. Exclusively matured in first fill Bourbon casks, Bowmore¡¯s newly launched No.1 Malt is singularly special. Vanilla sweetness, cinnamon spice and oak smoke beautifully complement the mouth-watering citrus, honeycomb and coconut flakes, culminating in a peat smoked, bourbon vanilla and lime finish. 15 Year Matured in an inspired combination of both bourbon and sherry casks, it's the final three years spent in Oloroso sherry casks that gives Bowmore 15 Year Old, one of the most beautifully balanced Bowmores, the rich, deep colour reflected in its name, and its warming finish.

Octomore 10.2 edition has spent the first four years of its life in fresh bourbon barrels, before being moved into exceptionally high quality, and incredibly rare Sauternes casks. The reputable chateau who originally managed these casks had filled them three times over with French sweet wine, allowing the oak to mellow and therefore temper its influence in our subsequent spirit. The combination of the softer smoke and oak influence has created a sublime balance with tropical fruit notes.

In Victorian times, when Bruichladdich Distillery was built, all Scottish barley was organically grown. The relationship between distiller, farmer and soil was intimate and enduring. These ties were lost as industrialised farming cut through ancient synergies and an age of super efficient blandness was born.

The presence of the Borderies cru among these eaux-de-vie gives the Cognac a rounder flavor and greater aromatic length.

Captain Morgan The Original Rum is a premium blend of five rum marques from three different Caribbean countries, creating rich complexity of flavour. With its intense colour and rich caramel and vanilla notes, the full-bodied taste is perfect for those who seek authentic adventure with their crew. It is blended according to an age-old recipe of rums from Jamaica, Guyana and Barbados. After distillation, the rum is aged for at least two years in charred oak barrels before the Ron Maestro (master blender) performs his art in the secret blending of the finished liquid. The result is a superior quality rum with a rich and smooth taste. Flavours of toffee and vanilla are perfectly balanced by the smoky cask finish. Enjoy the legendary full-bodied flavour in a tankard over ice, served with Cola or fiery Ginger Ale and a twist of lime. Captain Morgan was a real life person in the 17th century Jamaica. Starting out as a buccaneer, later becoming a captain and ending up as the governor of Jamaica, Morgan's colourful life was full of fun adventures with his crew. In Jamaica his interests turned to his sugar cane plantation and the perfection of a rum worthy to bear his name. The spirit of Sir Henry Morgan lives on in his legendary rum drinks.

Captain Morgan The Original Rum is a premium blend of five rum marques from three different Caribbean countries, creating rich complexity of flavour. With its intense colour and rich caramel and vanilla notes, the full-bodied taste is perfect for those who seek authentic adventure with their crew. It is blended according to an age-old recipe of rums from Jamaica, Guyana and Barbados. After distillation, the rum is aged for at least two years in charred oak barrels before the Ron Maestro (master blender) performs his art in the secret blending of the finished liquid. The result is a superior quality rum with a rich and smooth taste. Flavours of toffee and vanilla are perfectly balanced by the smoky cask finish. Enjoy the legendary full-bodied flavour in a tankard over ice, served with Cola or fiery Ginger Ale and a twist of lime. Captain Morgan was a real life person in the 17th century Jamaica. Starting out as a buccaneer, later becoming a captain and ending up as the governor of Jamaica, Morgan's colourful life was full of fun adventures with his crew. In Jamaica his interests turned to his sugar cane plantation and the perfection of a rum worthy to bear his name. The spirit of Sir Henry Morgan lives on in his legendary rum drinks. Live Like the Captain!

The secret to making Asyla is the quality of the casks. They use only whiskies aged in first-fill American oak casks because these yield whiskies with more vanilla character, more richness and more sweetness than refill casks. Asyla is made with 50% malt whisky. There are few blended Scotches that use as high a malt content as we do at Compass Box. The result is a carefully crafted, elegant blended Scotch whisky that makes the perfect aperitif. Asyla is part of the Signature Range from Compass Box. The five Scotch whiskies in this range cover the entire spectrum of Scotch whisky styles, from the delicate, sweet character of Asyla, to the subtle vanilla, clove and fruity characteristics of Oak Cross, the rich and spice notes of The Spice Tree, the peaty-smokycharacter of The Peat Monster and the elegant flavours of vanilla cream, toffee and coconut in Hedonism. Each is made from the highest quality casks, to create more complexity. The whiskies are combined according to each recipe and returned to casks for marrying up to 24 months before bottling. Steps like these enhance complexity, flavour integration and soft mouthfeel.

Hedonism is unusual in the Scotch whisky world: a blended grain Scotch whisky. It is very rare to see 100% grain whisky bottlings, in Scotland. Going back 100 years, grain whisky brands were more common, but they were overtaken in popularity by the big brands of blended Scotch, which comprised both grain whisky and malt whisky. Today, most Scotch grain whisky gets blended into the big brand names, typically at young ages. For Hedonism, we search for old casks of Scotch grain whisky. And we only produce Hedonism once a year, when we nd casks with the right avour pro le. When good Scotch grain whisky is aged in good quality American oak casks, the results can be stunning: a rich, sweet, alluring whisky, redolent of vanilla, pastry cream and coconut. You¡¯ll nd all these things in our Hedonism bottlings. We believe that great Scotch grain whisky is the little-known treasure of the Scotch whisky industry. Hedonism is part of the Signature Range from Compass Box. The ve Scotch whiskies in this range cover the entire spectrum of Scotch whisky styles, from the delicate, sweet character of Asyla, to the subtle vanilla, clove and fruity characteristics of Oak Cross, the rich and spice notes of The Spice Tree, the peaty- smoky character of The Peat Monster and the elegant avours of vanilla cream, toffee and coconut in Hedonism. Each is made from the highest quality casks, to create more complexity. The whiskies are combined according to each recipe and returned to casks for marrying up to 24 months before bottling. Steps like these enhance complexity, avour integration and soft mouthfeel. Extra steps, but we think they¡¯re worth it.
","¡°Hedonism is a unique and award-winning blended grain Scotch whisky. We produce it once or twice per year, depending on our ability to source the quality of casks we require. Rare and old, it¡¯s something special for both the collector and the new whisky enthusiast.Flavour Descriptors: Elegant flavours of vanilla cream, toffee, coconut.Recommendations: As an aperitif, serve with a small amount of chilled water.

A rich, medium-bodied blended malt Scotch whisky, Oak Cross combines vanilla characters from American oak and spicy, clove-like characters from French oak. They work with a small mill in France that produces some of the highest quality cooperage oak in the world. It was our work with this mill that led us to experimenting with secondary maturation of malt whiskies in casks tted with new French oak heads. This is something no one else in Scotland does. The result is whisky with more character and complexity. This technique is used on about 40% of the whisky in Oak Cross and it results in a superior finished product. Oak Cross is part of the Signature Range from Compass Box. The five Scotch whiskies in this range cover the entire spectrum of Scotch whisky styles, from the delicate, sweet character of Asyla, to the subtle vanilla, clove and fruity characteristics of Oak Cross, the rich and spice notes of The Spice Tree, the peaty- smoky character of The Peat Monster and the elegant avours of vanilla cream, toffee and coconut in Hedonism. Each is made from casks chosen individually, cask-by-cask, to ensure perfect maturity. The whiskies are combined according to each recipe and returned to casks for marrying up to 24 months before bottling. Steps like these enhance complexity, flavour integration and soft mouthfeel.
","¡°Flavour: On the palate, notes of clove and vanilla accent a sweet maltiness and subtle fruit character.Recommendations: Suitable as an aperitif served with a chilled water in the winter months. Full enough to serve as a summertime digestif. Excellent match formany cheeses.Distillery Sourcing: Made entirely of Highland single malt whiskies from the villages of Brora (fruitiness), Carron (meatiness) and Alness (perfume).Wood: All the whiskies are aged for their primary maturation in a mix of American oak cask types.

Connemara is the only peated single malt to come out of Ireland. This Irish gem takes its inspiration from its eponymous region: wild, sweeping landscapes overflowing with fertile natural resources that lend it all of its unique character. Colour: a faded honey glow. On the nose: a little pine resin brings a real freshness that leads towards a gentle aromatic peat. Honey, pear drops and freshly sliced green apples. It¡¯s an inviting and approachable nose without grabbing you by the throat. A little smoke that transcends into smoked bacon, then barley sweets. In the mouth: it¡¯s a little flat and non-defined. A lashing of vegetative peat but this moves quickly aside leaving a slight pepperiness and little else. Apples again and then smoked cream and brown toast. A touch of redness from the finish but its all a bit flaccid.

The secret to making Asyla is the quality of the casks. They use only whiskies aged in first-fill American oak casks because these yield whiskies with more vanilla character, more richness and more sweetness than refill casks. Asyla is made with 50% malt whisky. There are few blended Scotches that use as high a malt content as we do at Compass Box. The result is a carefully crafted, elegant blended Scotch whisky that makes the perfect aperitif. Asyla is part of the Signature Range from Compass Box. The five Scotch whiskies in this range cover the entire spectrum of Scotch whisky styles, from the delicate, sweet character of Asyla, to the subtle vanilla, clove and fruity characteristics of Oak Cross, the rich and spice notes of The Spice Tree, the peaty-smokycharacter of The Peat Monster and the elegant flavours of vanilla cream, toffee and coconut in Hedonism.

Hedonism is unusual in the Scotch whisky world: a blended grain Scotch whisky. It is very rare to see 100% grain whisky bottlings, in Scotland. Going back 100 years, grain whisky brands were more common, but they were overtaken in popularity by the big brands of blended Scotch, which comprised both grain whisky and malt whisky. Today, most Scotch grain whisky gets blended into the big brand names, typically at young ages. For Hedonism, we search for old casks of Scotch grain whisky. And we only produce Hedonism once a year, when we nd casks with the right avour pro le. When good Scotch grain whisky is aged in good quality American oak casks, the results can be stunning: a rich, sweet, alluring whisky, redolent of vanilla, pastry cream and coconut. You¡¯ll nd all these things in our Hedonism bottlings. We believe that great Scotch grain whisky is the little-known treasure of the Scotch whisky industry. Hedonism is part of the Signature Range from Compass Box. The ve Scotch whiskies in this range cover the entire spectrum of Scotch whisky styles, from the delicate, sweet character of Asyla, to the subtle vanilla, clove and fruity characteristics of Oak Cross, the rich and spice notes of The Spice Tree, the peaty- smoky character of The Peat Monster and the elegant avours of vanilla cream, toffee and coconut in Hedonism. Each is made from the highest quality casks, to create more complexity. The whiskies are combined according to each recipe and returned to casks for marrying up to 24 months before bottling. Steps like these enhance complexity, avour integration and soft mouthfeel. Extra steps, but we think they¡¯re worth it.
","¡°Hedonism is a unique and award-winning blended grain Scotch whisky. We produce it once or twice per year, depending on our ability to source the quality of casks we require. Rare and old, it¡¯s something special for both the collector and the new whisky enthusiast.Flavour Descriptors: Elegant flavours of vanilla cream, toffee, coconut.Recommendations: As an aperitif, serve with a small amount of chilled water. Late in the evening, serve neat.

In 1263, Colin of Kintail, Chief of the Clan Mackenzie, took a bold decision to stand up and be counted, and felled a charging stag which attacked King Alexander III of Scotland. In return for saving his life, the grateful King gifted the 12-pointed Royal Stag emblem to the Mackenzie Clan as a reward. When descendants of the Mackenzie Clan took over the ownership of The Dalmore distillery in 1867, they continued to honour this brave act and proudly put the 12-pointed Royal Stag on the bottle. To this day, the Stag still adorns each and every bottle of The Dalmore. To celebrate the pioneering and innovative values of the Mackenzie Clan, their Master Distiller has painstakingly created the only single malt in the world to unite a unique six cask finish for one outstanding achievement. Spirits matured in ex-bourbon casks, Matusalem oloroso sherry butts, Madeira barrels, Marsala casks, Port pipes and Cabernet Sauvignon wine barriques are combined in perfect harmony to create a uniquely complex, yet smooth single malt. This is the embodiment of brave creativity and a lifetime¡¯s experience.

Flor de Ca?a is a naturally aged rum enriched by the unique properties of the San Cristobal volcano, the most active in Nicaragua. The fertility of its soil, the enriched volcanic water and the hot volcanic climate to which the barrels are exposed during the aging process contribute to Flor de Ca?a¡¯s singularly smooth and deliciously balanced character. In 1890, Francisco Alfredo Pellas Canessa, along with the founders, began to celebrate the end of the agricultural harvest season with small quantities of aged rum. More than 125 years later, the entire production process continues under the supervision of the same family (five generations of mastery and family values), achieving perfection in rum making. FLOR DE CA?A 12 YEAR This reddish, 12-year-old amber ultra-premium rum is stately, elegant and semi-sweet. It¡¯s delicious neat, on the rocks or with a splash of water or soda. It won a Gold Medal in 2016 at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. The Flor de Ca?a 12 Years is making history with its excellent elaboration. FLOR DE CA?A 7 YEAR GRAN RESERVA A 7-year-old, mahogany-hued, extra-smooth and full-bodied rum, recommended for sipping with sparkling water and a twist of orange or in the Flor Old-Fashioned cocktail, which is prepared with brown sugar, three to four drops of coffee bitters, a splash of sparkling water and two orange rinds. FLOR DE CA?A 4 YEAR ULTRA LITE A 4-year-old rum, with 28 degrees of alcohol/volume, this rum is light and crystal-clear, exceptionally smooth and intense in flavor and aroma.

            A special annual release made by distilling Christmas puddings, and ageing that gin 100-year old Muscat barrels. Tastes like gin, smells like Christmas.

Each year on Derby Day, Cam distills Christmas puddings by putting them in the botanical basket of our still and distilling a base of juniper, cinnamon, star anise, coriander seed and angelica over the top. This gin is then aged in 100+ year old Muscat barrels. Cam adds some Muscat to finish, rounding out the palate and adding a touch of richness.

The result smells like gin and tastes like Christmas. Aromatics of classic juniper and a hint of cinnamon, back up with a rich, luscious palate with a hint of sweetness from the Muscat and richness from the extended barrel ageing.

Flowing in the Valley of the Deer since 1887, this signature expression is the world¡¯s most awarded single malt Scotch whisky.

                  In Glenfiddich's first groundbreaking experiment, Malt Master Brian Kinsman has proven that traditional whisky casks can still be seasoned in a pioneering way. Collaborating with a local Speyside craft brewer, Brian created a bold and zesty IPA beer to imbue their rich oak casks with extra hoppy notes. The experiment resulted in the first single malt Scotch whisky ever finished in craft IPA casks.

The whiskey's unique character stems from its aging in selected barrels only. Part of the drink is aged in French Limousin wooden barrels, also used to age cognac and high-quality wines, for a limited time only, in order not to overshadow the rest of the beverage. The French wood enhances the strength of the whiskey, and creates a richer, creamier finish.

The 15 Year Old gets its distinctive rich and exotic character from a process of selective maturation in which a proportion of the spirit is matured in French oak casks. In fact, we at The Glenlivet were one of the first to use French oak for making whisky, a technique that has since been imitated the world over. The Limousin oak we use is cut in France¡¯s Dordogne region, where it¡¯s often used to mature cognacs. Its low density allows whisky to sink deep into the wood, and we carefully control how long the whisky matures in the casks so as not to overpower the desired result: a unique, pleasing spiciness. This process increases the intensity of the whisky, creating a rich, creamy finish, with buttery notes. The 15 Year Old is deep gold in colour, and leaves behind traces of sweet almond and spice. It¡¯s luxury in a glass.

Over the course of 18 years our Master Distiller, Alan Winchester, takes this expression through a combination of cask types, including both first and second-fill American oak (for tropical fruitiness) and ex-sherry oak (for spicy complexity).

The 18 Year Old has won more awards than any other expression; every bottle is a true example of the quality and taste of The Glenlivet.

The 15 Year Old gets its distinctive rich and exotic character from a process of selective maturation in which a proportion of the spirit is matured in French oak casks. In fact, we at The Glenlivet were one of the first to use French oak for making whisky, a technique that has since been imitated the world over. The Limousin oak we use is cut in France¡¯s Dordogne region, where it¡¯s often used to mature cognacs. Its low density allows whisky to sink deep into the wood, and we carefully control how long the whisky matures in the casks so as not to overpower the desired result: a unique, pleasing spiciness. This process increases the intensity of the whisky, creating a rich, creamy finish, with buttery notes. The 15 Year Old is deep gold in colour, and leaves behind traces of sweet almond and spice. It¡¯s luxury in a glass.

Boasting the classic flavours of The Glenlivet bound up in a creamy, smooth texture, this expression is their tribute to the one who started it all. George Smith, the founder, was a trailblazer with an irrepressible spirit. In creating a whisky in his honour they were understandably keen to do him justice. The Glenlivet Founder¡¯s Reserve captures the distinct, smooth, fruity taste that he first envisioned in 1824 and for which they are still renowned today. And because they remain as dedicated to innovation as their founder ever was, they have given this classic single malt a contemporary twist. To truly capture the essence of George Smith¡¯s vision, The Glenlivet Founder¡¯s Reserve has been created using the time-honoured distillation methods that he introduced so long ago. Made with water from the same crystal-clear mountain streams, in the same cold, pure air, The Glenlivet Founder¡¯s Reserve is as smooth and fruity as the whisky that first ran from the original copper pot stills. These unique, lantern-shaped copper stills, designed by the man himself, are not the only important tools in thier distilling legacy. The traditional oak casks in which they mature the whisky give each expression its own distinct characteristics. When George Smith began distilling, The Glenlivet had no age statements and he selected whisky from casks of a range of ages. They have replicated this freedom with The Glenlivet Founder¡¯s Reserve, selecting whisky from a variety of traditional aged oak casks. Then, to lend a modern twist to the flavour of the expression, Master Distiller Alan Winchester marries together a selection of the aged oak casks and American first-fill oak casks. American first-fill oak casks are those that have never before been used to mature Scotch Whisky. Selective use of these casks provides a smooth, creamy sweetness that mingles harmoniously with the delicate flavours and complex fruity tones already present in the whisky.
","¡°The result is an exceptionally well-balanced and smooth single malt. On the nose there are delicate aromas of citrus fruit, while the palate is sweet, with notes of oranges and pears, and hints of toffee apples and candy. The long, creamy, smooth finish makes this a deliciously satisfying expression.¡±","It's a nice whisky, and pleasant to sip.

The Glenlivet legacy lives on in this incredibly sweet and smooth spirit. The cornerstone of the range, the Master Distiller¡¯s Reserve showcases the approach perfectly: the traditional oak casks represent the classic style of The Glenlivet (ripe pear, gentle summery notes), while first-fill American oak provides depth and creaminess (coconut, soft fudge). Finally, ex-sherry oak brings complexity and richness (dried fruit, spice). Maturation in three types of oak makes for three times the character. This bright and lively gold expression has pear and fudge on the nose and fruit and spice on the palate. To finish, it dazzles with hints of marzipan and hazelnut. With so many flavours, this is a spirit to savour¡­ make sure you seek it out next time you travel. Available exclusively in Singapore at Paneco.com.

N¨¤durra, meaning ¡°natural¡± in Gaelic, is The Glenlivet¡¯s range of small-batch expressions made using traditional 19th-century techniques. The N¨¤durra First Fill is drawn from casks made of American white oak which have never before been used to mature Scotch whisky. These oak casks, which distillers at The Glenlivet have favoured since the early 1900s, impart hints of creamy vanilla to this wonderfully rich single malt. You¡¯ll really taste the effects of that white oak, beautifully complemented by sweet pear, tropical pineapple, ripe banana and citric sparkle. This is a cask-strength single malt that represents the skill of our team and the tradition of The Glenlivet. And unlike most modern whiskies, this one is non-chill filtered, so it¡¯s very richly textured. It¡¯s an expression that will appeal to the intrepid whisky lover.

The N¨¤durra range uses traditional 19th-century production methods to create inventive and original whiskies. This version is matured in first-fill Oloroso sherry oak casks from the Spanish region of Jerez. The sherry-soaked wood introduces the rich, sultry flavours of dried fruit and warm spice. N¨¤durra Oloroso, like all expressions in the range, is bottled and released in small batches, and, unlike most modern whiskies, is non-chill filtered so has all the body you would expect from a whisky that has been drawn straight from the cask. It¡¯s a bright, vivacious gold liquid, with aromas of dried fruit and spice. To drink, it¡¯s smooth and creamy with chocolate and marmalade. This is a divine example of what happens when you bring together Spanish passion and Speyside tradition. This whisky is all about using traditions to achieve modern brilliance.

Boasting the classic flavours of The Glenlivet bound up in a creamy, smooth texture, this expression is their tribute to the one who started it all. George Smith, the founder, was a trailblazer with an irrepressible spirit. In creating a whisky in his honour they were understandably keen to do him justice. The Glenlivet Founder¡¯s Reserve captures the distinct, smooth, fruity taste that he first envisioned in 1824 and for which they are still renowned today. And because they remain as dedicated to innovation as their founder ever was, they have given this classic single malt a contemporary twist. To truly capture the essence of George Smith¡¯s vision, The Glenlivet Founder¡¯s Reserve has been created using the time-honoured distillation methods that he introduced so long ago. Made with water from the same crystal-clear mountain streams, in the same cold, pure air, The Glenlivet Founder¡¯s Reserve is as smooth and fruity as the whisky that first ran from the original copper pot stills. These unique, lantern-shaped copper stills, designed by the man himself, are not the only important tools in thier distilling legacy. The traditional oak casks in which they mature the whisky give each expression its own distinct characteristics. When George Smith began distilling, The Glenlivet had no age statements and he selected whisky from casks of a range of ages. They have replicated this freedom with The Glenlivet Founder¡¯s Reserve, selecting whisky from a variety of traditional aged oak casks. Then, to lend a modern twist to the flavour of the expression, Master Distiller Alan Winchester marries together a selection of the aged oak casks and American first-fill oak casks. American first-fill oak casks are those that have never before been used to mature Scotch Whisky. Selective use of these casks provides a smooth, creamy sweetness that mingles harmoniously with the delicate flavours and complex fruity tones already present in the whisky.
","¡°The result is an exceptionally well-balanced and smooth single malt. On the nose there are delicate aromas of citrus fruit, while the palate is sweet, with notes of oranges and pears, and hints of toffee apples and candy. The long, creamy, smooth finish makes this a deliciously satisfying expression.¡±","It's a nice whisky, and pleasant to sip.

The Glenlivet legacy lives on in this incredibly sweet and smooth spirit. The cornerstone of the range, the Master Distiller¡¯s Reserve showcases the approach perfectly: the traditional oak casks represent the classic style of The Glenlivet (ripe pear, gentle summery notes), while first-fill American oak provides depth and creaminess (coconut, soft fudge). Finally, ex-sherry oak brings complexity and richness (dried fruit, spice). Maturation in three types of oak makes for three times the character. This bright and lively gold expression has pear and fudge on the nose and fruit and spice on the palate. To finish, it dazzles with hints of marzipan and hazelnut. With so many flavours, this is a spirit to savour¡­ make sure you seek it out next time you travel. Available exclusively in Singapore at Paneco.com.

N¨¤durra, meaning ¡°natural¡± in Gaelic, is The Glenlivet¡¯s range of small-batch expressions made using traditional 19th-century techniques. The N¨¤durra First Fill is drawn from casks made of American white oak which have never before been used to mature Scotch whisky. These oak casks, which distillers at The Glenlivet have favoured since the early 1900s, impart hints of creamy vanilla to this wonderfully rich single malt. You¡¯ll really taste the effects of that white oak, beautifully complemented by sweet pear, tropical pineapple, ripe banana and citric sparkle. This is a cask-strength single malt that represents the skill of our team and the tradition of The Glenlivet. And unlike most modern whiskies, this one is non-chill filtered, so it¡¯s very richly textured. It¡¯s an expression that will appeal to the intrepid whisky lover.

The N¨¤durra range uses traditional 19th-century production methods to create inventive and original whiskies. This version is matured in first-fill Oloroso sherry oak casks from the Spanish region of Jerez. The sherry-soaked wood introduces the rich, sultry flavours of dried fruit and warm spice. N¨¤durra Oloroso, like all expressions in the range, is bottled and released in small batches, and, unlike most modern whiskies, is non-chill filtered so has all the body you would expect from a whisky that has been drawn straight from the cask. It¡¯s a bright, vivacious gold liquid, with aromas of dried fruit and spice. To drink, it¡¯s smooth and creamy with chocolate and marmalade. This is a divine example of what happens when you bring together Spanish passion and Speyside tradition. This whisky is all about using traditions to achieve modern brilliance.

                  Drawing on Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge heritage, the fifth and sixth generations of the Marnier-Lapostolle family have created Quintessence, a sublime reinterpretation of the original creation.

The bigaradia peel is soaked in neat alcohol to create the first distillate; another batch of peel is then added to achieve a double distillation, which refines and intensifies the aroma. These intricate processes help to develop an exceptional aromatic richness - never has a liqueur been so exciting...

Rouge stands for along with the Marnier Lapostolle family¡¯s know-how.

Champagne and twice distilled Citrus bigaradia orange essence lends

In William Grant¡¯s journey from cow herder to founding father of one of the world¡¯s most loved Scotch brands, it¡¯s fair to say he had a little help along the way. It was in 1887 when William Grant opened his first distillery in Scotland with the help of his seven sons and two daughters. William Grant knew a thing or two about a good workforce. George Grant was his maltman, Charlie Grant operated the tuns, Alec Grant was his still-man, and his youngest daughter Meta? Well, the seven year old brought the boys lunch. Now that's a family business. Grant's Select Reserve should be reserved for the select few that you owe most of all. Who would you share a glass with?

Old Parr Blended Scotch Whisky recently announced that its Old Parr Aged 18 Years is a permanent addition to the brand¡¯s portfolio and is headed to the American market. This blend is aged 18 years and features what¡¯s described as a balance of fruity, sweet, and aged wood notes. It contains rare malts from Cragganmore in its blend which gives it a complex yet smooth flavor of oak. The fruit-like tastes of a Speyside and the smokiness of peat from Islay round out the blend. The Old Parr oval-shaped bottle is made with a crackled texture meant to resemble ancient tavern bottles. To this day, every bottle of Old Parr is sealed with signatures of its founders, the Greenlees brothers.

Fran?ois¡¯ passion for crafting extraordinary spirits began as a cellar master in cognac and led him to create Grey Goose, a vodka built from the ground up through a field to bottle process that celebrates the quality and taste of its ingredients. By delving deeper into his expertise, Thibault has created a unique, new expression of Grey Goose ¨C one that draws from past tradition, and expertly marries a hint of precious cognac with Grey Goose vodka to create something truly distinctive.

                  Cherry Heering is an elegant and full flavoured cherry liqueur and essential ingredient for iconic cocktails such as the Singapore Sling or the Blood and Sand. 

- In 1818, the young Peter F. Heering saw the intrinsic potential in an old cherry liqueur recipe that was bestowed upon him. The word spread and soon everybody wanted a taste of the sophisticated Danish liqueur. 

- During all of its 200-year-long history, Cherry Heering has been a small but indispensable component of iconic cocktails such as the Singapore Sling and Blood and Sand. 

- The main ingredients for Cherry Heering are dark red sour cherries called ""Stevns"" (in Danish) that grow on the island of Zealand, Denmark, and give the liqueur its unique fruity taste.

They function to complement and set the stage for the delicious duet of infusions: rose petal and cucumber. Hendrick¡¯s is the marriage of two different spirits from two rare and unusual stills: the Bennet still and the Carter-Head still. By combining the two, they are able to create an extraordinarily smooth gin that has the required character and balance of subtle flavours. They infuse their gin with the remarkable Bulgarian Rosa Damascena and specially selected cucumbers from the finest producers.

Hendrick¡¯s wondrous botanical signature consists of flowers, roots, fruits, and seeds from the world over. They function to complement and set the stage for the delicious duet of infusions: rose petal and cucumber. Hendrick¡¯s is the marriage of two different spirits from two rare and unusual stills: the Bennet still and the Carter-Head still. By combining the two, they are able to create an extraordinarily smooth gin that has the required character and balance of subtle flavours. They infuse their gin with the remarkable Bulgarian Rosa Damascena and specially selected cucumbers from the finest producers.

In 18 Year Old Viking Pride Travel Edition, they celebrate doing things their own way and the commitment to the craft of whisky-making. One crucial aspect of that craft is harmonisation. After marrying whisky from different casks together, they then give the liquid valuable time to harmonise in the cask before being bottled. A deliberately slow and unhurried stage, long since abandoned by many distilleries, cask harmonisation is what helps to achieve the intense balance that is its hallmark. By using a high proportion of first-fill sherry seasoned European and American oak casks and bottling 18 Year Old Viking Pride Travel Edition at its marrying strength of 46% ABV, the whisky¡¯s delicious notes of heather honey, chocolate and cherries are intensified.

Highland Dragon Legend is a single malt as bold and unconventional as Sigurd himself. The woodless peat from Hobbister Moor delivers a profusion of aromatic smokiness. Then, there¡¯s the sweet fragrant spiciness that comes from slow maturation in sherry-seasoned European and American oak casks. The result is a whisky with a more intense smokiness than the 12 Year Old, and with a flavour profile of freshly cut wood, dollops of vanilla custard and notes of lemon and honey.

Highland Dragon Legend is a single malt as bold and unconventional as Sigurd himself. The woodless peat from Hobbister Moor delivers a profusion of aromatic smokiness. Then, there¡¯s the sweet fragrant spiciness that comes from slow maturation in sherry-seasoned European and American oak casks. The result is a whisky with a more intense smokiness than the 12 Year Old, and with a flavour profile of freshly cut wood, dollops of vanilla custard and notes of lemon and honey. Then, comes that signature smokiness - inimitable Highland Park harmony.

Jameson Black Barrel is a tribute to the cooper¡¯s method of charring barrels. Charring is an age old method for invigorating barrels, but these days we use double charred barrels by choice rather than through necessity. Time spent maturing in these barrels lends this whiskey intensified notes of vanilla sweetness and caramel, alongside toasted wood, fruit, and warm spice. A triple distilled blend of ¡®small batch¡¯ grain and traditional Irish pot still whiskeys, Jameson Black Barrel reveals untold richness and complexity. Every barrel contains secrets; the trick is coaxing them out. A triple distilled, twice charred, one of a kind.

The brainchild of Belfast-barman, Gerry White, Jawbox is a small batch gin named after the ever-celebrated Belfast sink colloquially known as the ¡®Jawbox¡¯. This classic dry gin is an ode to a time when the front door was left unlocked and the scullery was home to the heart of the kitchen, the big sink, where the craic was heard and unforgettable stories were shared. Inspired by the magnificent industrial era of Northern Irish history when ordinary men and women put Belfast on the map for hard graft and craft, Jawbox is a modern expression of this traditional, impressive and uncompromising character. The Ards Peninsula is home to The Jawbox Distillery and the fields where its grain is grown and harvested. It's here where things are done the hard way, for the right reasons. First, the grain is distilled slowly in a tradition copper pot still, a careful selection of local and exotic botanicals are then steeped overnight in the warmed spirit, releasing their maximum influence and preserving their delicate flavours and aromas. On the nose, Jawbox is an impressive experience of bold juniper and pine, balanced with a gentle touch of sweet coriander and clean citrus. More complex on the palate, citrus and juniper develop into peppery, earthy Angelica root, finishing with citrus and lingering juniper and pine. The preferred Jawbox serve encourages us to favour the unusual and calls on a Belfast-invented accompaniment, ginger ale. To enjoy the 'Perfect Swerve', pour 50ml Jawbox into an ice-filled glass, topping up with premium Ginger Ale and garnishing with a squeeze and a wedge of zesty lime.

The brainchild of Belfast-barman, Gerry White, Jawbox is a small batch gin named after the ever-celebrated Belfast sink colloquially known as the ¡®Jawbox¡¯. This classic dry gin is an ode to a time when the front door was left unlocked and the scullery was home to the heart of the kitchen, the big sink, where the craic was heard and unforgettable stories were shared. Inspired by the magnificent industrial era of Northern Irish history when ordinary men and women put Belfast on the map for hard graft and craft, Jawbox is a modern expression of this traditional, impressive and uncompromising character. The Ards Peninsula is home to The Jawbox Distillery and the fields where its grain is grown and harvested. It's here where things are done the hard way, for the right reasons. First, the grain is distilled slowly in a tradition copper pot still, a careful selection of local and exotic botanicals are then steeped overnight in the warmed spirit, releasing their maximum influence and preserving their delicate flavours and aromas. On the nose, Jawbox is an impressive experience of bold juniper and pine, balanced with a gentle touch of sweet coriander and clean citrus. More complex on the palate, citrus and juniper develop into peppery, earthy Angelica root, finishing with citrus and lingering juniper and pine. The preferred Jawbox serve encourages us to favour the unusual and calls on a Belfast-invented accompaniment, ginger ale. To enjoy the 'Perfect Swerve', pour 50ml Jawbox into an ice-filled glass, topping up with premium Ginger Ale and garnishing with a squeeze and a wedge of zesty lime.

Johnnie Walker Blue Label is incomparably rich and smoky, with velvety smooth breaking waves of powerful flavour. Created from hand-selected casks of some of the rarest and most exceptional whiskies, there is no sensory experience quite like Johnnie Walker Blue Label. Hazelnuts, honey, sherry and oranges tumble in first, before releasing hidden secrets like ginger, kumquats, sandalwood and dark chocolate. A rich honey sweetness emerges, accompanied by hints of pepper and dried fruits, before an impossibly long, lingering, smooth finish of perfectly balanced, soft smoke.
","¡°Johnnie Walker Blue Label is an unrivaled masterpiece. It is an exquisite blend made from some of Scotland¡¯s rarest and most exceptional Scotch Whiskies. Only one in every ten thousand casks has the elusive quality, character and flavor to deliver the¡¯ remarkable signature taste of Johnnie Walker Blue Label. An extraordinary Scotch Whisky for extraordinary occasions.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

The Laphroaig 25 Year Old was lovingly created by marrying Laphroaig that has been aged in Oloroso sherry casks along with Laphroaig that has been matured in ex-American bourbon barrels; both filled with newly distilled Laphroaig spirit from day one. When you unite the sherried, oaky flavours from the second fill sherry casks with the creamy, smooth, sweet flavours from the bourbon barrels you create the magic that is Laphroaig 25 Year Old. Bottled at cask strength, it is a perfect fusion of two different styles of maturation flavours, made even smoother by the quarter century it has been gently maturing.

In this way the aromas and sensory features of Sangiovese Grosso can be brought out. The perfection union of modern technology and past traditions make for a winning combination in a product that fully reflects the unparalleled characteristics of the Montalcino area.

This is a classic Lagavulin - a mild nose with a light prickle. It is clear, fresh top of medical supplies; dentists' mouthwash, carbolic, and medicine cupboards, all atop an ashy based, similar to that of a recently extinguished peated fire. There are savoury notes and a mineral maritime note. The palate is a natural strength, unexpectedly sweet and smooth in texture, very smoky from the off. The finish is sweet, warm, long, and delightfully smoky. With water it becomes smoother and sweeter, though the smokiness reasserts itself at the close.

This peated whisky is renowned for its bold, smoky taste, followed by a hint of seaweed and a surprising sweetness.

The Laphroaig 25 Year Old was lovingly created by marrying Laphroaig that has been aged in Oloroso sherry casks along with Laphroaig that has been matured in ex-American bourbon barrels; both filled with newly distilled Laphroaig spirit from day one. When you unite the sherried, oaky flavours from the second fill sherry casks with the creamy, smooth, sweet flavours from the bourbon barrels you create the magic that is Laphroaig 25 Year Old. Bottled at cask strength, it is a perfect fusion of two different styles of maturation flavours, made even smoother by the quarter century it has been gently maturing.

The wheat grows on the distillers own farm in Austria and is distilled twice with juniper berries and our leopold spirits recipe of botanicals. The high-proof sloe gin ages up to one year in stainless steel so that it still can better develop its character. After the aging process the Gin gets his drinkable strength of 27% vol. alc. For the refinement, some beet sugar from the house owned farm is added to create a balance of sweet and sourness in smell and taste. Due to the high-water quality of the own springs in upper Austria, the sloe gin gets its very mild and soft finish.

                  Licor 43 is a Zamora family secret comprising of 43 natural ingredients. 

Although it is rested for about 6 - 9 months in stanless steel tanks, the exact resting period is entirely up to the liqueur expert. What's interesting is that, it stays in a cooling chamber at -5 Celsius to achieve a perfect, smooth finish.

Enjoy it neat, on the rocks or with cocktails.

Heritage in a glass. An inviting dark amber colour encases notes of ginger, oak and fruit. Every Macallan single malt reveals the unrivalled commitment to the mastery of wood and spirit for which The Macallan has been known since it was established in 1824. It is an expression of our enduring desire to go beyond ordinary, to seek out the extraordinary, and create peerless single malts. With an unflinching commitment to put sherry casks at the heart of The Macallan single malt, our reputation for the extraordinary is testament to the exceptional oak casks in which we mature our spirit. Sourced, crafted, toasted and seasoned under the watchful eye of The Macallan Master of Wood, these hand-picked casks are delivered to the demanding specifications of The Macallan Master Distiller and his team. Once filled, the maturing spirit remains undisturbed in the same casks for the necessary number of years it needs to be worthy of its destined Macallan expression. It is these oak casks that make the greatest contribution to the quality, natural colour and distinctive aromas and flavours which lie at the heart of The Macallan single malt.

Crafted to showcase complexity and depth, Rare Cask is drawn from the broadest spectrum of casks, 16 different types, ever identified by the Master Whisky Maker. Far less than 1% of those casks maturing at the distillery have been identified as fitting to bestow the Rare Cask name. Combining Spanish and American sherry seasoned oak casks, a high proportion of them first fill, gives rise to an exquisite whisky with a splendidly rich hue, and an unmistakably woody whisky. Soft notes of opulent vanilla and raisin on the nose, give way to apple, lemon, and orange. Balanced by a spicy quartet of root ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Oak resonates, timeless, polished and rich. Vanilla and chocolate lead the finale along with a light citrus zest. The finish is full, warming and woody. *Batch No 1. 2019 Release.

A bold and full bodied single malt with an intense natural colour. Part of The Macallan Masters Decanter Series created to showcase the beautiful range of The Macallan¡¯s natural colour, Reflexion embodies the foremost influence of first fill sherry seasoned oak casks. This exceptional single malt draws its colour and flavour from maturation in smaller hogshead casks, allowing a greater surface area of wood to interact with the whisky to deliver an intricate character influenced by both Spanish and American oak casks. The depth of colour and complex flavour of Reflexion is derived from the use of first-fill casks, carefully selected for this distinctive expression to accentuate its aromas and flavours. Bold and full bodied, Reflexion is a celebration of floral and vanilla notes, punctuated with fresh apples and apricots. This whisky's deep red mahogany hue, taken directly from the cask, is enhanced by the angular facets of the carefully crafted decanter that each reflect the light to showcase the depth of colour.

Part of The Macallan Masters Decanter Series created to showcase the beautiful range of The Macallan¡¯s natural colour, Reflexion embodies the foremost influence of first fill sherry seasoned oak casks. This exceptional single malt draws its colour and flavour from maturation in smaller hogshead casks, allowing a greater surface area of wood to interact with the whisky to deliver an intricate character influenced by both Spanish and American oak casks. The depth of colour and complex flavour of Reflexion is derived from the use of first-fill casks, carefully selected for this distinctive expression to accentuate its aromas and flavours. Bold and full bodied, Reflexion is a celebration of floral and vanilla notes, punctuated with fresh apples and apricots. This whisky's deep red mahogany hue, taken directly from the cask, is enhanced by the angular facets of the carefully crafted decanter that each reflect the light to showcase the depth of colour.

In 2007, eleven intact bottles containing this perfectly preserved whisky were recovered from under the ice beneath Shackleton's base camp.

He has combined the best Highland malt whiskies, allowing them to marry over a long period to create an enigmatic blended malt with a dash of body and a whisper of smoke. It has complex notes of vanilla, honey and orchard fruits with real warmth and depth at its heart, like Shackleton himself.

More than 60 years ago, Kentucky distiller Bill Samuels, Sr., founder of Maker's Mark, set out simply to make a bourbon whisky that he would enjoy drinking. Using soft, red winter wheat in the mashbill instead of the traditional distiller's rye, he created a premium bourbon that was full-flavored, yet soft and never bitter: Maker's Mark. Bill Samuels, Sr., transformed bourbon from a ""commodity"" into a premium spirit, and today Maker's Mark continues to be made with care in exactly the same way. Since the first bottle sold in 1958, each iconic bottle is still hand-dipped with a red wax by people, not machines.

Shackleton ordered 25 cases of Mackinlay's Rare Old Highland Malt Whisky to take on his expedition of 1907. In 2007, eleven intact bottles containing this perfectly preserved whisky were recovered from under the ice beneath Shackleton's base camp. Master Blender, Richard Paterson, created this Shackleton whisky as a personal and deeply felt project. He has combined the best Highland malt whiskies, allowing them to marry over a long period to create an enigmatic blended malt with a dash of body and a whisper of smoke. It has complex notes of vanilla, honey and orchard fruits with real warmth and depth at its heart, like Shackleton himself.

Maker's Mark 46 was created by Bill Samuels, Jr., to amplify the flavors he loves in Maker's Mark. The innovative wood-stave-finishing process starts with fully matured Maker's Mark at cask strength followed by inserting 10 seared virgin French oak staves into the barrel and finish it for nine weeks in our limestone cellar. The result is Maker's Mark 46: bolder and more complex, but without the bitterness typical of longer-aged whiskies.

More than 60 years ago, Kentucky distiller Bill Samuels, Sr., founder of Maker's Mark, set out simply to make a bourbon whisky that he would enjoy drinking. Using soft, red winter wheat in the mashbill instead of the traditional distiller's rye, he created a premium bourbon that was full-flavored, yet soft and never bitter: Maker's Mark. Bill Samuels, Sr., transformed bourbon from a ""commodity"" into a premium spirit, and today Maker's Mark continues to be made with care in exactly the same way. Since the first bottle sold in 1958, each iconic bottle is still hand-dipped with a red wax by people, not machines.

Vermouth Martini Bianco (""white"" in Italian) is produced from a blend of strengthened, spiced and sweetened white wines. This unique blend gives the beverage its rich drink, thanks to the wonderful contrast between the bitterness of the spicing herbs and the sweetness of sugar. The Martini Bianco is commonly served as an aperitif before meal.
","¡°For a wine to be called vermouth, the wormwood herb (Wermuth in German) must be one of its components. In the past, the original function of the wormwood was to disguise unpleasant flavors and fragrances in low-quality alcoholic beverages. Despite the inferior image of sweetened wines, Martini Bianco surprised the market with its rich flavor when it was initially launched in the beginning of the 20th century. This quality immediately turned it into a hit. Today vermouth Martini, manufactured by the Italian Martini & Rossi (also known as ""Martini"") is the most popular and best-selling vermouth worldwide.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

Vermouth Martini Bianco (""white"" in Italian) is produced from a blend of strengthened, spiced and sweetened white wines. This unique blend gives the beverage its rich drink, thanks to the wonderful contrast between the bitterness of the spicing herbs and the sweetness of sugar. The Martini Bianco is commonly served as an aperitif before meal.
","¡°For a wine to be called vermouth, the wormwood herb (Wermuth in German) must be one of its components. In the past, the original function of the wormwood was to disguise unpleasant flavors and fragrances in low-quality alcoholic beverages. Despite the inferior image of sweetened wines, Martini Bianco surprised the market with its rich flavor when it was initially launched in the beginning of the 20th century. This quality immediately turned it into a hit. Today vermouth Martini, manufactured by the Italian Martini & Rossi (also known as ""Martini"") is the most popular and best-selling vermouth worldwide.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

In addition to their rarity, both musk melons are cultivated in rich soils to create the tastiest melons.

Midori Melon Liqueur was inspired by a Japanese visionary. Shinjiro Torii, founder of Suntory, had a lifetime dream to create a colorful Western liqueur.

Paddy is one of Ireland¡¯s favourite whiskeys and is the only major Irish whiskey to use single malt in its blend, thus creating its uniquely rich & mellow flavour. First distilled in 1779, the whiskey originally sold under the unlikely name ¡°Cork Distilleries Company Old Irish Whiskey¡± until a young salesman by the name of Paddy Flaherty joined the company in 1881. Paddy was a larger than life character who became famous in his native county for standing rounds of his favourite whiskey. Over time, Paddy became synonomous with the whiskey and publicans began writing to the distillery asking for another case of ¡°Paddy¡¯s whiskey¡±. Despite frequent differences of opinion with his employers concerning his unconventional sales techniques, the ¡°Paddy whiskey¡± name stuck so much so that in 1912, the distillery owners bowed to public pressure and officially changed the name to ¡°Paddy Irish Whiskey¡±. It could only happen in Ireland! Paddy Whiskey is distilled three times from the finest quality barley and water. This ensures a whiskey, which is particularly light, well balanced and pure. Its relatively low pot-still content and uniquely high proportion of malt whiskey, ensures Paddy is one of the softest of all Ireland's whiskeys. During maturation in oak casks stored in dark aromatic warehouses for up to seven years, Paddy whiskey mellows, and takes on it's distinctive rich, golden colour. Two percent of Paddy Whiskey is lost to the atmosphere during maturation. This evaporated whiskey has come to be called 'The Angel's Share'.
","¡°Paddy is now enjoying export success, and has become an iconic brand with night-clubbers in France.Paddy¡¯s mellow flavour means it can be enjoyed mixed in a long drink with cola, lemonade or ginger ale, or in the more traditional manner - neat, on ice, or with water.NoseFresh and lively, aromatic - a complex interplay of nutty maltiness, woodland fragrances and spice, with hints of honey and vanilla.TasteMild, soft, a distinctive mellow maltiness, a touch of sweet oil, spiciness - and again those background notes of honey, vanilla, toasted wood.FinishA sweetness gently fading, mellow maltiness and mild woody notes lingering pleasingly.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

Cellar N¡ã16 contains new casks, which together with the warmer air in the upper parts of the cellar give rise to intense vanilla notes.

The cognac is called ¡°Prime Cellar Selection¡± because Cellar N¡ã16 contains new casks that are the prime location for aging.

                  It all began in Marseille in the 1930s, when cafes sold any number of anise-based liqueurs, most of them illicit and too sweet for consumers¡¯ tastes. In Sainte-Marthe, Paul Ricard, a wine-merchant¡¯s son, dreamt of finding a formula ¡°that would meet everyone¡¯s tastes¡±. In his improvised laboratory he would macerate Proven?al plants, fennel seeds, aniseed essence and more.

One day in 1932, he finally had his recipe, declaring, ¡°It shall be called Ricard, the real pastis from Marseille!¡± At the age of only 23, Paul Ricard had just invented the first French long drink: one volume of pastis with five volumes of water, served with ice. ¡°I am willing to put my name on it,¡± he proclaimed, ¡°because I am sure of the quality of this pastis and proud of its unique taste¡±.

The young man had studied fine arts and so designed his drink¡¯s first poster and label. Ricard pastis was an immediate hit. By 1938, sales already stood at 2.4 million litres. In 1984 the by now world-famous brand celebrated its billionth bottle.

The main ingredient is star anise, harvested in southern China where only the best fruits are handpicked, sundried and distilled on site to produce anise essential oil, which preserves the star anise¡¯s full aroma. This rigorous selection process ensures that only the finest anise essential oils are used.

The pursuit of the finest flavours also takes us to the Middle East, in quest of another natural ingredient: liquorice. The most aromatic liquorice roots are selected on site as soon as they are harvested. This is the ingredient that gives Ricard pastis its roundness and legendary yellow hue.

The journey ends in Provence¡¯s garrigue. Thyme? Sarriette? Marjoram? The famous recipe remains secret, but owes much of its success to the aromas produced by Proven?al plants.
<<<<<<< HEAD
                ","¡°In accordance with Paul Ricard¡¯s original recipe, Ricard pastis should be served cold. It should be prepared by adding 10cl of chilled water to 2cl of Ricard and then adding the ice cubes last. This ritual will release the full aroma of the anise.Ricard can be more or less diluted according to taste.The unique recipe makes for an ideal combination with cordials (like pomegranate, mint, orgeat or grapefruit) or fruit juices (mango, strawberry, cranberry). These different combinations produce a variety of colours and flavours for a new way to discover (or rediscover) the full flavour of anise.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

This ritual will release the full aroma of the anise.Ricard can be more or less diluted according to taste.The unique recipe makes for an ideal combination with cordials (like pomegranate, mint, orgeat or grapefruit) or fruit juices (mango, strawberry, cranberry). These different combinations produce a variety of colours and flavours for a new way to discover (or rediscover) the full flavour of anise.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

                  Smirnoff No. 21 is the world's No. 1 vodka. Its classic taste has inspired other varieties throughout all four corners of the globe.

The Smirnoff brand was founded in 1864 by Piotr Arseneevich Smirnov and before long, he became one of the most famous vodka makers in Russia. In 1886, he even received the Tsar¡¯s special designation as a Purveyor of the Imperial Court, which is a fancy way of saying Official Vodka-Maker of Tsar Type People. This was based both on the fact that his vodkas were delicious and that Tsars tend to like to make things official.

When the Bolsheviks took over, the distilleries were shut down and P.A.¡¯s son Vladimir was chased out of town with pitchforks and also dinner forks, since the whole thing happened suddenly and not everyone had a pitchfork with them.

Vladimir Smirnov was able to flee to Constantinople and then eventually settle in France where he sold vodka under the name ¡°Smirnoff.¡± Now safely disguised by a new name and a slightly offensive fake French accent, Vladimir revived the brand.

Talisker distillery is an Island single malt Scotch whisky distillery based in Carbost, Scotland on the Isle of Skye. The distillery is currently operated by Diageo. The distillery was founded in 1830 by Hugh and Kenneth MacAskill, who leased the Talisker House from Clan MacLeod and eventually converted it into a distillery. Talisker Single Malt Whisky is made from malted barley sourced from the Muir of Ord, a village in Highland, Scotland. The barley is lightly peated which gives it the smokey toasty smell and presence in the mouth. Talisker Distiller¡¯s Edition 2015 Single Malt Scotch Whisky was distilled in 2005 and matured for ten years in used, American bourbon casks, then it was double-barreled, or finished, in casks that were previously used to mature Amoroso sherry, which give it that nice dark chocolate salty sweetness.
","¡°Nose: Lots of smoke and dusty saw wood. Some sherry and citrus bananas and fruits are present as well. As with all Talisker¡¯s there is a whiff of salty air about it, that mixes together and creates one of the most complex noses I have smelled. Very interested. Swirling the whisky around in the glass opens up to iodine as well.Palate: Fruits, Vanilla and Dark Cocoa chocolate. Some more smoke but not as strong as it is on the nose.Finish: Sea salt and coastal finish, short to medium, doesn¡¯t really linger on the tongue.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

A bottle design that reflects the aesthetics of Japan. The six natural Japanese botanicals are embossed on the hexagonal bottle that symbolises ROKU (which means ¡®six¡¯ in Japanese). Sakura flower, Sakura leaf, Yuzu peel, Sencha tea (green tea), Gyokuro tea (refined green tea) and Sansh¨­ pepper. Six Japanese botanicals cultivated over four seasons, the six Japanese botanicals have been carefully selected to create ROKU, Japan¡¯s authentic craft gin. Each botanical has been harvested at the peak of its season to extract the best flavour, and distilled to fully embody the blessings of nature. The harvest of the four seasons has been blended to create ROKU¡¯s balanced flavour. Cherry blossom and green tea provide a floral and sweet aroma to this complex, multi layered, yet harmonious flavour of various botanicals. Traditional gin taste in the base, plus characteristic Japanese botanical notes with yuzu as the top note. Smooth and silky texture with a little spiciness to the finish provided by the crisp Japanese sansho pepper.

Talisker distillery is an Island single malt Scotch whisky distillery based in Carbost, Scotland on the Isle of Skye. The distillery is currently operated by Diageo. The distillery was founded in 1830 by Hugh and Kenneth MacAskill, who leased the Talisker House from Clan MacLeod and eventually converted it into a distillery. Talisker Single Malt Whisky is made from malted barley sourced from the Muir of Ord, a village in Highland, Scotland. The barley is lightly peated which gives it the smokey toasty smell and presence in the mouth. Talisker Distiller¡¯s Edition 2015 Single Malt Scotch Whisky was distilled in 2005 and matured for ten years in used, American bourbon casks, then it was double-barreled, or finished, in casks that were previously used to mature Amoroso sherry, which give it that nice dark chocolate salty sweetness.
","¡°Nose: Lots of smoke and dusty saw wood. Some sherry and citrus bananas and fruits are present as well. As with all Talisker¡¯s there is a whiff of salty air about it, that mixes together and creates one of the most complex noses I have smelled. Very interested. Swirling the whisky around in the glass opens up to iodine as well.Palate: Fruits, Vanilla and Dark Cocoa chocolate. Some more smoke but not as strong as it is on the nose.Finish: Sea salt and coastal finish, short to medium, doesn¡¯t really linger on the tongue.¡±",,,,,,Spirit,[]

At reduced strength the texture becomes softer and the taste cooling and creamy. Burnt sugar and cocoa against a developing background of wooden pencil boxes, joined by raisins, dates, allspice and a trace of white chocolate.Finish: Long and complex. Oily, with finely coating dry, dark chocolate and fresh oak-wood. A rising pungency offers up espresso coffee and charred notes of treacle toffee and chocolate cake.
