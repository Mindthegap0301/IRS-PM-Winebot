The purchase of various land parcels and subsequent new plantings the domain has grown to include land in the cities of Santenay, Savigny, Pommard . and most recently around Rully.

During the growth of the winery, we have maintained our care for the old soils which were long esteemed for production of the Santenay Blanc.

Some of these had been abandoned for over a century, and our wines have since earned the title of Grand Vins de Bourgogne ( great white wines of Burgundy). Our vineyard is the main producer of the Santenay Blanc (white wine).

Georges Royer planted his first vineyards on the hills of the village of Landreville in the middle of the Cote des Bars in 1960. It is his children and grandchildren who run the company in 2010 with 22 hectares of vineyard. It is therefore a small champagne producer compared to the large well-known trading houses.
The Cuvee Reserve is made from 75% pinot noir and 25% chardonnay grapes. This successful champagne regularly wins prizes. For example at the Concours Mondial in Brussels where the wine received a gold medal.

Together with renowned consultant oenologist Eric Boissenot, Château de Citran produces this wonderfully seductive wine, with harmonious balance, elegance and complexity. 2010 was an exceptional season. The sunny, warm weather during the growing season and near-perfect climatic conditions throughout, contributed to the success of this vintage. 2010 is characterised by a strong concentration of anthocyanins, ripe and silky tannins and wonderful power.

                  Denis Carré was not born into a wine family.  When he reached his teenage years and had harvested grapes in his native Burgundy for a few years, he knew what he wanted to do. 

​In 1975 he took his savings and rented a parcel of vines, later producing three barrels of Passetoutgrain.  While financing his dreams working in a garage at night, his days were spent in the vines and small winery he began constructing in the late seventies in Meloisey in the Hautes Côtes de Beaune.Nearly forty years later, the old family house is now surrounded by a modern winery and underground aging cellars.

Their 13 hectares of vines are spread over 8 appellations from which they produce 12 wines.

This rose wine is produced with grapes left to dry slightly before being vinified.

Governo Rosso Toscano is a blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet and Merlot according to the ancient Tuscan method ""Governo"", in which, after the first fermentation, dried grapes are added.

This rose wine is produced with grapes left to dry slightly before being vinified. The drying technique involves reducing the weight of the grapes due to the evaporation of the water in the berries. As a result, the aromatic substances, sugars and organic acids are concentrated. The resulting wine has a strong character, intense aromas and a savory taste.

The palate is rich and warm with a velvety texture. It is a wine that wants to seduce from the first approach, ideal for a romantic evening or to combine with savory dishes such as roasts or aged cheeses. Partial drying of the grapes before vinification in fact determines a concentration of substances in the grapes due to the evaporation of water.

                  The striking Durbanville Hills cellar sits on the side of a series of rolling hills with magnificent views of Table Mountain and Table Bay - the very geography that lies at the heart of what makes the wines so unique.

Crushing and juice handling, varying from immediate draining to an average of four hours skin contact, was conducted under dry ice (CO2) to preserve the typical delicate flavours. Cold fermentation at 13-15 degrees Celcius, followed by extended contact with the lees for almost two weeks, contributes to the full mouth-feel of the wine.

Founded in 1760, Champagne Lanson is one of the oldest producers in the region, with a rich history embedded in the famous city of Reims.

Developing steadily and winning numerous awards over the years, they gained real prominence in the 1900s, becoming official supplier to the British court. Champagne Lanson have since gone on to sponsor the The Championships, Wimbledon - one of the UK's oldest and most traditional sporting competitions - for over forty years.Lanson's prestige cuvée is produced from a careful selection of grapes from Grand Cru rated vineyards only. The very essence of the Lanson style, Noble embodies all the fruity, grape-flavour freshness so characteristic of the House.

From the largest family-owned line of esteemed Champagne, Laurent Perrier has been at the forefront of the champagne-making business founded in 1812. In 1881, when Cellar Master Eugène Laurent took over the Alphonse Pierlot Champagne House, he purchased vines in the very best terroirs of Bouzy, Tours-sur-Marne, and Ambonnay, excavated 800 metres of cellars, and set up a tasting laboratory. Today, that is how the Domaine Laurent-Perrier (the Estate) was anchored in Tours-sur-Marne. This picturesque village is ideally situated at the crossroads of the three main wine growing areas of the Marne department: the Montagne de Reims, the Vallée de la Marne and the Côte des Blancs. It is also part of the 17 Champagne villages ranking in the prestigious 'Grand Cru' area.

The typical character of the Maison Castel - Chardonnay Vin de France is derived from the blending and the vinification processes which result in a perfect balance of fruit and acidity. The grapes are chilled before undergoing a gentle pressing. After cold settling, alcoholic fermentation is carried out at low temperature. 1 to 3 months ageing enables the development of secondary aromas.

The Châteauneuf du Pape AOC is one of the oldest and most well known in the Rhône Valley.

The Provence wine region enjoys an exceptional amount of sunshine with hot summers accompanied by the Mistral wind, and its terroir is made up of a complex geology. Each wine is therefore imbued with the personality of its terroir resulting in a wide variety. The Maison Castel Côte de Provence wines are vinified at low temperature, depending on the yeast used. Once fermentation is completed, we age the wine on the gross lees or fine lees according to the potential of each vat. Malolactic fermenation is systematically prevented in order to retain as much freshness and tension in the wines as possible.

Founded in 1760, Champagne Lanson is one of the oldest producers in the region, with a rich history embedded in the famous city of Reims.

Developing steadily and winning numerous awards over the years, they gained real prominence in the 1900s, becoming official supplier to the British court.

From the largest family-owned line of esteemed Champagne, Laurent Perrier has been at the forefront of the champagne-making business founded in 1812. In 1881, when Cellar Master Eugène Laurent took over the Alphonse Pierlot Champagne House, he purchased vines in the very best terroirs of Bouzy, Tours-sur-Marne, and Ambonnay, excavated 800 metres of cellars, and set up a tasting laboratory. Today, that is how the Domaine Laurent-Perrier (the Estate) was anchored in Tours-sur-Marne. This picturesque village is ideally situated at the crossroads of the three main wine growing areas of the Marne department: the Montagne de Reims, the Vallée de la Marne and the Côte des Blancs. It is also part of the 17 Champagne villages ranking in the prestigious 'Grand Cru' area.

The typical character of the Maison Castel - Chardonnay Vin de France is derived from the blending and the vinification processes which result in a perfect balance of fruit and acidity. The grapes are chilled before undergoing a gentle pressing.

The Châteauneuf du Pape AOC is one of the oldest and most well known in the Rhône Valley.

The Provence wine region enjoys an exceptional amount of sunshine with hot summers accompanied by the Mistral wind, and its terroir is made up of a complex geology. Each wine is therefore imbued with the personality of its terroir resulting in a wide variety. The Maison Castel Côte de Provence wines are vinified at low temperature, depending on the yeast used. Once fermentation is completed, we age the wine on the gross lees or fine lees according to the potential of each vat. Malolactic fermenation is systematically prevented in order to retain as much freshness and tension in the wines as possible.

                  The Negroamaro used in Zìnzula is harvested in mid-September at the first light of dawn. The so-called ‘lacrima’ or static ‘dripping’ of the must is obtained under the grapes’ own weight in the press, with no maceration whatsoever. 

This technique allows for the extraction of a very delicate rosy tint and preserves the freshest varietal notes, keeping tannins and skin-related bitter notes to an absolute minimum. The resulting wine ferments in stainless steel tanks and stays on the fine lees for about 4 months, before a brief period of ageing in the bottle

                  The 2018 vintage was a cool, dry season which made fruit ripening nice and even, giving great flavour and acidity. The fruit for this limited release wine was sourced from our Schuberts Vineyard in the cool climate area of the Adelaide Hills. 

Coming from several topographic aspects allows different characteristics to play their part in this wine. South east facing fruit gives citrus notes and minerality. North facing slopes give palate fullness and stone fruit characters.

Veuve Clicquot Demi-Sec champagne honors the taste of the 19th century. The greater presence of Chardonnay enhances the sweetness and silkiness. Veuve Clicquot Demi-Sec is an indulgent treat for champagne lovers – and perfectly suited for dessert. As with all Veuve Clicquot blends, Demi-Sec is predominantly Pinot Noir (40-45%), which gives the champagne its fundamental structure. The pursuit of very distinct fruit flavors means that there is a higher level of Meunier (30-35%) in the blend than would typically be found in Yellow Label, for example, and Chardonnay completes the blend (20-25%).
","“Boasting a brilliant yellow color with deep golden highlights, this wine offers delicate bubbles and an intense nose of ripe fruit with hints of brioche. It is supple and full on the palate, while preserving its delightful, inherent freshness. After cellaring for two to three years, the Demi-Sec will take on even richer notes of praline.”",,Deep golden highlights,"Ripe fruits, Hints of toast and brioche","Roundness and mellowness, combined with a delightful freshness due to its gentle acidity",,,"['Fish', 'Seafood', 'Cheese', 'Dessert']"

Today Veuve Clicquot propels this tradition into the contemporary era with RICH, a champagne dedicated to mixology.

The Rich blend is comprised of Pinot Noir (45%), the main pillar of Veuve Clicquot’s winemaking, which gives the champagne its fundamental structure. The large part of Meunier (40%) provides roundness to the blend and Chardonnay (15%) completes it with extra freshness. For Rich Rosé, the blend is completed with 15% Pinot Noir red wine. Rich’s uniqueness is in its dosage of 60 g/L, which enhances the blend’s aromas. As Veuve Clicquot’s Cellar Master shares, “Sugar in champagne is like spices in a recipe: used correctly it can bring out specific aromas and play with flavors.
","“The fruit aromas in Veuve Clicquot RICH and RICH ROSÉ has been boosted to sensational new levels.

                  Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label Brut has been the symbol of the House since 1772. A perfect balance between power and finesse, its complexity comes from the predominant presence of Pinot Noir and Reserve Wines.

Veuve Clicquot Demi-Sec champagne honors the taste of the 19th century. The greater presence of Chardonnay enhances the sweetness and silkiness. Veuve Clicquot Demi-Sec is an indulgent treat for champagne lovers – and perfectly suited for dessert. As with all Veuve Clicquot blends, Demi-Sec is predominantly Pinot Noir (40-45%), which gives the champagne its fundamental structure. The pursuit of very distinct fruit flavors means that there is a higher level of Meunier (30-35%) in the blend than would typically be found in Yellow Label, for example, and Chardonnay completes the blend (20-25%).
","“Boasting a brilliant yellow color with deep golden highlights, this wine offers delicate bubbles and an intense nose of ripe fruit with hints of brioche. It is supple and full on the palate, while preserving its delightful, inherent freshness. After cellaring for two to three years, the Demi-Sec will take on even richer notes of praline.”",,Deep golden highlights,"Ripe fruits, Hints of toast and brioche","Roundness and mellowness, combined with a delightful freshness due to its gentle acidity",,,"['Fish', 'Seafood', 'Cheese', 'Dessert']"

                  In the history of Champagne, wines that were blended for greater sweetness were customarily described as “rich"". Even the 1840s bottles of Veuve Clicquot found recently in the Aland Islands have over 150 grams per liter of sugar. Today Veuve Clicquot propels this tradition into the contemporary era with RICH, a champagne dedicated to mixology.

The Rich blend is comprised of Pinot Noir (45%), the main pillar of Veuve Clicquot’s winemaking, which gives the champagne its fundamental structure. The large part of Meunier (40%) provides roundness to the blend and Chardonnay (15%) completes it with extra freshness. For Rich Rosé, the blend is completed with 15% Pinot Noir red wine. Rich’s uniqueness is in its dosage of 60 g/L, which enhances the blend’s aromas. As Veuve Clicquot’s Cellar Master shares, “Sugar in champagne is like spices in a recipe: used correctly it can bring out specific aromas and play with flavors.
","“The fruit aromas in Veuve Clicquot RICH and RICH ROSÉ has been boosted to sensational new levels.

Somewhat austere in its youth, the wine softens becoming velvety and developing prolonged and appealing aromatic persistence. For our Zonin Chianti wine the stems are separated from the grapes, which are softly pressed in cylinders under pressure gently breaking their skins and releasing the juice. The juice is left to macerate on the skins for about a week in temperature-controlled stainless steel vilifiers at about 28-30°C. After the alcoholic fermentation is over, the wine undergoes malolactic fermentation, lowering total acidity and making the wine seem rounder and fuller in flavour.

Somewhat austere in its youth, the wine softens becoming velvety and developing prolonged and appealing aromatic persistence. For our Zonin Chianti wine the stems are separated from the grapes, which are softly pressed in cylinders under pressure gently breaking their skins and releasing the juice. The juice is left to macerate on the skins for about a week in temperature-controlled stainless steel vilifiers at about 28-30°C. After the alcoholic fermentation is over, the wine undergoes malolactic fermentation, lowering total acidity and making the wine seem rounder and fuller in flavour.

It has an excellent ruby red color, legs, light tanins and body, lively notes and flavor with hints of cherries,great to go along italian cold cuts.”",,"Bright ruby-red color of an attractive intensity.

                  Salice Salentino is one of Puglia’s most successful denominations and one of the first to gain wide recognition abroad. Produced in the commune of Salice Salentino, which is situated between the provinces of Brindisi and Lecce, in the Salento peninsular  - the ""heel"" of Italy.

Vineyards thrive here because of the clay-limestone soils which are quite deep and rich in organic material. These soils retain groundwater reserves, and the vines are thus still able to yield high-quality wines.

Amodo Salice Salentino is produced from the Negroamaro grape which is blended with a little Malvasia Nera to soften the finished wine. This wine is produced by a subsidiary of Enoitalia, one of Italy's largest and best volume winemakers, using grapes from select vineyards.

The must, which comes from red wine devatted from maceration tanks, is rapidly cooled and filtered. It then undergoes alcoholic fermentation over the following days under strictly controlled conditions at 16-18 ̊C. The clarified and stabilised wines are then racked in stainless steel tanks until bottling in order to retain their full freshness.

                  Beringer Vineyards has owned and farmed its Knights Valley vineyards since the mid-1960s, when the Beringer family recognized that the cobbled, rocky alluvial soils were a great place to grow high quality wine grapes. 

The Knights Valley designation was first used on a Beringer label in 1974. Beringer was instrumental in garnering official recognition for the area in 1983 as a premier wine growing region with the award of its own American Viticulture Area (AVA) designation.

Knights  Valley  Reserve  is  a  barrel  selection,  a  blend  of  the  best  vineyard  lots  in  a  given  vintage.  To  maintain the unique characteristics of the different lots from varying areas of the vineyard, they are kept separate through vinification and aging, and only the most expressive are chosen for this Reserve bottling.  Extended  maceration  created  more  dominant  tannins,  enhancing  the  lush  mouthfeel  of  the  blend  while  extracting a maximum of color, aromas and flavors.

                  This wine was 100% machine harvested using new Pellenc fruit sorters. The grapes were crushed to bag presses leading to greater aromatic fruit expression. The freerun juice was then fermented slowly at cool temperatures to retain the very distinctive regional and varietal characters Marlborough has become famous for.

20% of the ferments occurred in French Oak cuve and 2% was fermented in New French Oak puncheon barrels. All components were left on full fermentation solids until blending occurred, encouraging not only some lees complexity in the final blend, but further enhancing the texture of the wine.

Select yeasts are introduced to bring out the aromas typical of this variety.
This is followed by a period of aging on “fine lees” to lock in the aromatics.

This 2011 will be vibrant and pleasing and will age gracefully for many years.

                  Vinification takes place in caratelli, the typical small Tuscan barrels holding between 100 and 200 liters (22 and 44 gallons), and it is triggered by the inoculation of the so-called “madre” (“mother”) - colonies of different types of yeast deriving from previous vinifications – into the must from grapes that have been partially dried on racks. 

Maturation continues for 8 years in the small chestnut–wood barrels, in which the fermentation lasts a very long time but is intermittent, starting and stopping depending on the natural variations of temperature and pressure.

                  Made from the finest Sangiovese grapes of the estate, the Castello Albola Reserve Sangiovese matures in oak for two years. It is a wine that expresses perfectly the terroir of Chianti Classico, whose very landscape it captures in the bottle. One can detect the high-altitude vineyards in its finesse, the heat of the earth in its depth and the nuances of woodlands in its extraordinarily persistent bouquet. Maturation lasts 15 months: 10% of the wine goes into Allier oak barriques, the remaining 90% into traditional Slavonian oak barrels. This is followed by 12 months’ maturation in stainless steel and a further three months in bottle before release.

The abbey of Saint-Bénigne in Dijon, the powerful Maison de Vergy, and the Dukes of Burgundy have all played their part in the history of these vineyards in the Côte Chalonnaise. 

Rully was granted its AOC in 1939 and now produces red wines (PinotNoir) and white wines (Chardonnay) with both village and Premier Cru appellations. Since the early 19th century it has been, in addition, an important centre for the making of CRÉMANT DE BOURGOGNE.

                  Sauvignon became the main grape variety in the twentieth century. It has a different expression on our terroirs to anywhere else and thus enabled Sancerre to receive the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée classification in 1936. The reds and rosés received the classification in 1956.

The white Sancerre wines, made exclusively from Sauvignon Blanc grapes, now account for 80% of production. Pinot noir grapes are reserved for the production of red and rosé Sancerre wines. By taking advantage of the advances in transportation methods, Sancerre wines quickly became very popular in Parisian bars and bistros. They were then exported worldwide. Today, 70% of our produce is exported across the world.

                  Before there was Almaviva, Clos Apalta, Seña or Viñedo Chadwick, there was Don Melchor, standing alone and apart from every other Chilean wine.

Named after the founder of Concha y Toro (the largest exporter of wines in all of Latin America), Don Melchor was the country’s first ‘Super-Chilean’ wine.

What’s interesting is Don Melchor specializes in just Cabernet Sauvignon; and this, is the highest rated and most expensive wine ever made from Cabernet Sauvignon in Puente Alto. The Don Melchor Cabernet Sauvignon has achieved worldwide approval as a collector’s Cabernet Sauvignon and prices have been rising over the past two years.

This wine from Cantina Ca Marcanda is the result of a combination of grape varieties that recall the French tradition and the historical incursions suffered by the territory of the upper Maremma.
The use of vines that for 55% are of Merlot, for 35% of Syrah, and for 10% of Sangiovese.
The different vineyards, both in Bolgheri and in the surrounding area of Bibbona, planted mainly on brown lands rich in silt and clay. The vinification provides that the grapes according to the variety carry out fermentation and maceration separately for about 15 days. After 12 months of aging in wood, the wine is blended and a few months in bottle before being marketed, after which it ages for 18 months

Upon delivery to the winery, fruit parcels were individually pressed and clarified. Fermentation was initiated with a selection of premium yeast strains. Cooler temperatures were maintained throughout to retain the fragrant aroma and flavours compounds. A variety of winemaking techniques were employed to build complexity and texture into the finished wine including yeast lees contact and malolactic fermentation.

                  A variety of crushing and fermentation techniques were employed for individual parcels of fruit. Approximately 50% of the fruit was fully de-stemmed and crushed into static fermenters, where it was fermented at 25ºC to 30ºC for 6-10 days. Other parcels of fruit were fully de-stemmed but only partly crushed to add a confectionery (whole berry ferment) character to the final blend. These ferments were pumped over twice daily to extract colour and flavour from the grape skins. Selected parcels of handpicked fruit were subject to carbonic maceration in small open fermenters.

                  Rigorous assessment of vineyards is essential to identify the fruit style suitable for this wine. Prior to harvest, careful monitoring of the selected vineyards was undertaken by the winemakers to assess flavour development and sugar accumulation. The decision to harvest was based on flavour intensity and varietal character. The fruit was de-stemmed, crushed and inoculated with wine yeast. The temperature range of fermentation was maintained between 20°C and 28°C for periods of 10 to 15 days. The fermenters were pumped over twice every 24hours to irrigate the grape skin cap, thus liberating the rich colour, fruit flavour and balanced tannins. Selected Cabernet Sauvignon parcels were matured in a selection of French and American oak hogsheads prior to blending, stabilising and filtration.

                  After rigorous vineyard inspections and meticulous attention to detail by our winemaking team, the highest quality Shiraz parcels were chosen. These parcels exhibited intense varietal characters which displayed exquisite Shiraz fruit flavours. The fruit was sourced predominantly from South Australian wine regions. Seasonal conditions enabled our Shiraz grapes to reach full maturity. This provided the winemaking team the best possible fruit to produce a range of rich, round and generous wines with great depth of flavour and soft balanced tannins. Fermentation took place over 10 – 15 days in a combination of static and rotary fermenters. Attention to strict cap management regimes and temperature control has helped the George Wyndham BIN 555 Shiraz to display the softness and generous flavour it is renowned for, coupled with great drinkability.

                  The ripening fruit parcels were closely monitored by the winemakers and harvested once fruit flavours reached the desired profile. The grapes were de-stemmed and crushed into static fermentation vessels and inoculated with a neutral wine yeast strain. Fermentation was undertaken for a period of between eight and fifteen days, with temperatures on the cooler end of the fermentation spectrum for selected batches to provide a degree of finesse, whilst other batches were managed with slightly warmer fermentation temperatures to ensure a gentle extraction of ripe tannins and a greater concentration of colour and flavour into the wine. Once the desired flavour and structure profile was achieved, the wines were drained and pressed into French oak and put through malolactic fermentation. The wines were matured in these barrels for up to 14 months. Only parcels with exceptional varietal flavour, structure and further potential for development were included in this premium blend.

                  This wine is produced in Puglia, Italy from 100% Negroamaro. These grapes are well-suited to Puglia's warmer temperatures and known for producing wines that are earthy and rustic, making them ideal for enjoying with food. The grapes were gently pressed and then fermented in stainless steel vats, including 18 days of skin contact, which increased the wine's complexity and softened its tannins. Deep in colour and layered in texture, this wine combines seductive fruity aromas, vanilla, and rich toasted oak flavours. Despite its higher alcohol volume of 14%, this wine contains little tannin and comes off as quite light. This is a great wine to enjoy alongside pasta favourites such as lasagna, cheese-filled tortellini, and manicotti.

Approximately 50% of the fruit was fully de-stemmed and crushed into static fermenters, where it was fermented at 25ºC to 30ºC for 6-10 days. Other parcels of fruit were fully de-stemmed but only partly crushed to add a confectionery (whole berry ferment) character to the final blend. These ferments were pumped over twice daily to extract colour and flavour from the grape skins. Selected parcels of handpicked fruit were subject to carbonic maceration in small open fermenters.

                  Rigorous assessment of vineyards is essential to identify the fruit style suitable for this wine. Prior to harvest, careful monitoring of the selected vineyards was undertaken by the winemakers to assess flavour development and sugar accumulation. The decision to harvest was based on flavour intensity and varietal character. The fruit was de-stemmed, crushed and inoculated with wine yeast. The temperature range of fermentation was maintained between 20°C and 28°C for periods of 10 to 15 days. The fermenters were pumped over twice every 24hours to irrigate the grape skin cap, thus liberating the rich colour, fruit flavour and balanced tannins. Selected Cabernet Sauvignon parcels were matured in a selection of French and American oak hogsheads prior to blending, stabilising and filtration.

                  The ripening fruit parcels were closely monitored by the winemakers and harvested once fruit flavours reached the desired profile. The grapes were de-stemmed and crushed into static fermentation vessels and inoculated with a neutral wine yeast strain. Fermentation was undertaken for a period of between eight and fifteen days, with temperatures on the cooler end of the fermentation spectrum for selected batches to provide a degree of finesse, whilst other batches were managed with slightly warmer fermentation temperatures to ensure a gentle extraction of ripe tannins and a greater concentration of colour and flavour into the wine. Once the desired flavour and structure profile was achieved, the wines were drained and pressed into French oak and put through malolactic fermentation.

                  This wine is produced in Puglia, Italy from 100% Negroamaro. These grapes are well-suited to Puglia's warmer temperatures and known for producing wines that are earthy and rustic, making them ideal for enjoying with food. The grapes were gently pressed and then fermented in stainless steel vats, including 18 days of skin contact, which increased the wine's complexity and softened its tannins. Deep in colour and layered in texture, this wine combines seductive fruity aromas, vanilla, and rich toasted oak flavours. Despite its higher alcohol volume of 14%, this wine contains little tannin and comes off as quite light. This is a great wine to enjoy alongside pasta favourites such as lasagna, cheese-filled tortellini, and manicotti.

                  History shows that Thomas Hardy first blended grapes from multiple regions in 1865. Thomas believed that blending grapes with different characteristics would complement and enhance the qualities of each region. So began Hardy’s rich blending heritage; with each new blend a unique code was created starting from A001.

Premium parcels of cabernet from McLaren Vale, Coonawarra, Margaret River and Frankland River were hand-picked and berry sorted, before undergoing a cool natural open fermentation, basket pressing and ageing in fine grain French oak. Meticulous blending has resulted in this outstanding example of Australian Cabernet Sauvignon.

Healthy canopies and above average crops combined with an extended mild summer with minimal heat spikes to produce very high quality fruit. Harvest began around 2 weeks later than in recent years with fruit showing excellent colour and flavour with bright natural acidity.

A Highly aromatic release full of red berry, spice and autumnal leaf with a palate of finesse, complexity and balance with soft juicy fruit profile, finishing with mineral acid. An excellent lead-up to harvest saw moderate yields and good berry size with cooler conditions for most of the growing season. A vintage without extremes of heat and later ripening than recent vintages saw fruit ripen slowly and steadily. Picked at optimum maturity then made in a way that combines old and new world techniques.

                  Jacquesson is a true craftsman's house worn by Brothers Laurent and Jean-Herve Chiquet, who took over from their father in the 1980’s. It is often referred as the nowadays Champagne revelation. Jacquesson vineyards are located in the Grand Cru villages of Ay, Avize and Oiry and in the Premier Cru villages of Dizy, Hautvillers and Mareuil-sur-Ay. About 15% of the fruit is sourced from growers in these villages as well as the Grand Cru village of Chouilly and the Premier Cru village Cumières.

The cuvee 700 concept is unique in Champagne and is the opposite of a non-vintage wine! The brothers seeks excellence rather than homogeneity and 'house style', in respect for the character of the vintage. The vineyards are mostly sloping, facing east, south or south-west where the chalk lies at varying depths below the soil.

This wine, dear to our heart, under Père Anselme signature, was created in 1952 by Charles Brotte with the co-operation of local Provençale glass and ceramic craftsmen. The original and surprising bottle shape represents the gnarled and twisted vines typical of the region due to their struggle of growing against the Mistral wind. It consists in twisting the bottles in sand, explaining its sandy texture. 
La Fiole, “Phiala” in latin refers to a “precious bottle”. The bottle is exclusive as we are the only winery permitted to use this shape. “Pape” evokes the cru of Châteauneuf-du-Pape as well as the presence of the Popes in the region and village in the Middle Ages. The bottle’s golden anthracite grey powder recalls wines of former times.
The wine is unique and of constant quality. A majority of Grenache, an important share of Reserve Wines – 30 to 40% (some of which are 5 years old) give it fruitiness, freshness and maturity, intensity and smoothness. The wine can be savoured immediately or be kept 5 to 7 years. La Fiole du Pape is the best selling Châteauneuf-du-Pape in the world.

Excellent on its own! To be paired with nice grilled fish, with salads and cheese.
Outstanding with modern cuisine. Serve between 46°F and 50°F.

La Villa Barton refers to the Place where Thomas Barton, one of the founders of the Barton & Guestier company, liked to relax when he was traveling through France to discover the wonderful diversity of French wines. 
La Villa Barton is a seductive and refined Côtes de Provence that makes you feel on the French Riviera.

Special care dedicated to the grapes after the picking to avoid oxidation and to
preserve a light pink color – destaling of grapes – maceration period for a few
hours – cold stabulation of the must - pressing - alcoholic fermentation at
controlled temperature (60-65°F) – ageing on fine lies for 4 months before
bottling. Two months on light toasted new acacia and French oak barrels for 20%
of the wine.

Low yields, hand tending, careful selection and minimal interference in the
natural ripening of the grapes. The winemaker of La Villa Barton Cotes de
Provence Rose is the former winemaker of Domaine D’Ott.

                  Created in 1876 for Tsar Alexander II, Cristal was the world’s first Cuvée de Prestige. Crafted from Grands Crus from the Montagne de Reims, the Vallée de la Marne and the Côte des Blancs, and the result of a unique savoir-faire and devotion, this rare champagne is the jewel in the Louis Roederer crown.

Symbolic of the perpetual quest for excellence that define Roederer today led by Frédéric Rouzaud, Cristal is also radically different to any other champagne on the market.

As the Cristal Brut showed impressive personality, Jean-Baptiste Lécaillon, Cellar Master, decided to extend its ageing to ten years. This has endowed this vintage with remarkable maturity and contributed to its surprising and exacting temperament.

The Provence wine region enjoys an exceptional amount of sunshine with hot summers accompanied by the Mistral wind, and its terroir is made up of a complex geology. Each wine is therefore imbued with the personality of its terroir resulting in a wide variety. The Maison Castel Côte de Provence wines are vinified at low temperature, depending on the yeast used. Once fermentation is completed, we age the wine on the gross lees or fine lees according to the potential of each vat. Malolactic fermenation is systematically prevented in order to retain as much freshness and tension in the wines as possible.

The Provence wine region enjoys an exceptional amount of sunshine with hot summers accompanied by the Mistral wind, and its terroir is made up of a complex geology. Each wine is therefore imbued with the personality of its terroir resulting in a wide variety. The Maison Castel Côte de Provence wines are vinified at low temperature, depending on the yeast used. Once fermentation is completed, we age the wine on the gross lees or fine lees according to the potential of each vat. Malolactic fermenation is systematically prevented in order to retain as much freshness and tension in the wines as possible.

The wine was then stabilised and prepared for bottling.

                  Bin 2 was first released in 1960, yet was temporarily discontinued in Australia in the 1970s at the height of the white wine boom. The original Bin 2 was an ‘Australian Burgundy’ style (despite its Rhône varieties) – typically a soft, medium bodied wine based on shiraz. The Bin 2 blend of shiraz and mataro is still relatively uncommon in Australian table wines. Also known as monastrell or mourvèdre, mataro was introduced to Australia in the 1830s. Often used in fortified wine production, this grape is widely planted in the Barossa Valley.

It is valued by winemakers for its blending attributes, adding complexity and palate grip. Interest in Bin 2 has grown as the popularity of traditional Rhône varieties and blends continues to flourish.

                  Bin 389 is often referred to as ‘Baby Grange’, in part because components of the wine are matured in the same barrels that held the previous vintage of Grange. 

First made in 1960, by the legendary Max Schubert, this was the wine that helped to forge Penfolds solid reputation with red wine drinkers combining the structure of Cabernet Sauvignon with the richness of Shiraz. Bin 389 also exemplifies the judicious balance of fruit and oak.

The wine is characterized by its rich sweetness and subtle velvety mouth feel in which chocolate, coffee, fruits and spices dominate the senses.

Chianti DOCG occupies a special place in the heart-- and history-- of Ruffino. When Ilario and Leopoldo Ruffino founded the winery in 1877, the first wine they produced was a Chianti. And it was the reputation of this wine that launched Ruffino's early success. In fact, before World War I Ruffino was the only Chianti exported from Italy to the United States, making it an ambassador to wine lovers around the world. In keeping with tradition, Chianti DOCG features a distinct Florentine bottle reminiscent of the fiasco, the straw-dressed flask in which Chianti was originally bottled. Today, Ruffino Chianti DOCG serves as a benchmark for quality and consistency. For many wine lovers worldwide, Ruffino Chianti is Chianti. Grapes from the best-known regions of Chianti are used to make Chianti DOCG. Fermentation is aided by racking and punch-downs in temperature-controlled stainless steel and concrete vats. The Chianti DOCG is then aged for four months in stainless steel and concrete vats.

In 1962, Miguel A. Torres had just completed his studies in France. Driven by the energy of freshly acquired knowledge, he traveled back and forth between Vilafranca and a small cellar in Pontons to observe the results of fermenting grapes in the coldest area of the Penedès. He states ""During the early 1960s, after completing my viticulture and enology studies in France, I wanted to put into practice what I had learned in Dijon. At a small winery in Pontons, a mountainous area where the nights are very cold, I first fermented grapes at a low temperature to obtain a fresher and more aromatic white wine. This fortunate discovery provided the basis for what is now Viña Sol, which we continue to make with utmost care to this day, half a century later.”

In 1962, Miguel A. Torres had just completed his studies in France. Driven by the energy of freshly acquired knowledge, he traveled back and forth between Vilafranca and a small cellar in Pontons to observe the results of fermenting grapes in the coldest area of the Penedès. He states ""During the early 1960s, after completing my viticulture and enology studies in France, I wanted to put into practice what I had learned in Dijon. At a small winery in Pontons, a mountainous area where the nights are very cold, I first fermented grapes at a low temperature to obtain a fresher and more aromatic white wine. This fortunate discovery provided the basis for what is now Viña Sol, which we continue to make with utmost care to this day, half a century later.”

                  The coppery champagne, the burst of red fruit aromas…to achieve it, the blend is an essential element, a creative act. The Cellar Master and his team of experts select excellent quality red wines and still wines from some of the most sought-after vineyards in Champagne to find the flavors and characteristics that perfectly express the Veuve Clicquot Rosé style.
Made using 50 to 60 different crus, and 30 to 45% of Reserve wines, the cuvée is based on Yellow Label’s traditional blend: the Pinot Noir predominance (50-55%) provides the structure that is so typically Veuve Clicquot, while Chardonnay (28-33%) adds the elegance and finesse essential in a perfectly balanced wine, and a touch of Meunier (15-20%) rounds out the blend.

Once alcoholic and malolactic fermentation are completed the wines are drawn off and lightly clarified before being racked into barrels. The wine is aged 18 months in barrels of American oak (20% of which are new), before being left in bottles for at least two more years.

                  Altitude has a significant effect on grape growing; the concentration of oxygen, the amount of sunlight exposure, as well as the temperature. At 313m above sea level, the grapes picked for Wolf Blass Altitude Adelaide Hills Chardonnay achieve excellent levels of freshness and acidity. Adelaide Hills’ high altitude climate is further tempered by occasional fog and cloud cover, which, combined with long bursts of gentle sunshine, allow for long, slow ripening and full flavour development.

                  In its 44th vintage, Wolf Blass Black Label Cabernet Shiraz Malbec has been artfully blended to create a sophisticated red wine. Built on complex, multi-layered flavour and magnificent structure, Black Label is a powerful expression of the Wolf Blass philosophy of synergistic blending. Harvested at optimum maturity and flavour, fruit from each vineyard was crushed, destemmed and fermented separately for seven to twelve days on skins. The ferments were allowed to warm naturally, with plunging and gentle pumping over used to maximise colour and flavour extraction. Mid-ferment cooling extended fermentation, exploiting time on skins and accentuating line and length. Some batches stayed on skins to dryness, while others completed fermentation in barrel, allowing a balanced integration of oak characters and enhancing texture and complexity
